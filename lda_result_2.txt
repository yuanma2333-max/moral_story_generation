["Once upon a time there was a shy and quiet octopus. He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious. One day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers. The octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish. A couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area.

['In a far away land there was once a type of small wild car that would drive freely around the countryside. They didn\'t need motorways or gasoline, since all they needed to be able to move was good thoughts and desires - a rather original idea of their eccentric inventor. Those cars became really famous, and the wild car races were everyone\'s favourite pastime. Every boy dreamt about driving one, as their light weight and their honesty and sincerity made them ideal drivers. And as it was difficult to find light children with such good hearts that they could maintain good thoughts throughout an entire race, there were often tests to discover new talent, during which every boy would have a unique opportunity to demonstrate his ability with the wild cars. So, one day, the testing team arrived at the small town where nicky lived. Nicky was a good kid who, like many others, didn\'t sleep that night, while queueing up, waiting his turn to drive one of the cars. During the wait, many boys rehearsed and practiced their good wishes and thoughts, but as soon as the gates were opened, a great lot of elbowing and pushing revealed that not all were as good as they appeared. However, the organisers expected this kind of thing, and after a few simple tests such as thanking someone for giving you a chocolate, helping to prepare the races, and respectfully attending to a rather annoying little old lady, there was only a small group of really good children left. Nicky was among them. So, those children took turns to get into the cars and do a few laps of the circuit. Nicky would go last, but it didn\'t bother him much, since he enjoyed seeing up close how the cars accelerated. When his turn came, his heart was beating ten to the dozen. Due to the excitement, he could hardly run, and so was about the last to get into his car. He was so happy, that he was a little late in realising that there was one last boy yet to get into his car; a boy who walked using crutches, and who hadn\'t been able to reach the car earlier. Nicky could hear the head of testing say:   -"I\'m very sorry, my boy, there are no cars left, and this is the last test of the day. the cars have to be rested soon. come on, you\'ll get your opportunity some other day…"Seeing the shine of excitement disappear from that boy\'s face, and witnessing his deep sadness, nicky took a deep breath, got out of his car and said:   -"It\'s ok, he can have my car."The engine of that car roared like never before, while the injured boy got in, filled with joy. Nicky was happy at what he had done, though a little bit disappointed. But before setting off, the other boy saw the hint of sadness in nicky\'s face and, grateful to him, reached out his hand, saying:   -"Get in. we\'ll go together, even though it\'ll make us a bit slower."Nicky leapt in. The two happily embraced, but they hardly managed to do anything else. Their car thundered like a rocket, and made off at the speed of light!

They had always known they were special, and they harboured inside them a desire that, in the future, everyone would come to admit how exceptional they were. Each of them developed in a different way. The first used all his talent and intelligence to have a successful career and show everyone his superiority. He took part in all kinds of competitions, visited all the most important people and places, and was great at making friends in high places. Even when still very young, no one doubted that some day he would be the wisest and most important person in the land. The second boy, equally aware of his own capabilities, never stopped feeling a heavy responsibility. He would do almost any task better than those around him, and he would feel obliged to help them. This didn't leave him enough time to follow his own dreams of greatness. He was always busy looking for ways to more effectively help others. As a result, he was a much-loved and well-known person, but only in his own small circle. Destiny was such that a great disaster struck that land, spreading problems and misery far and wide. The first of those brilliant young men had never come across anything like this, but his brilliant ideas worked successfully throughout the land, and they managed to slightly improve the situation. But the second young man was so used to solving all kinds of problems, and had such useful know-how in certain subjects, that the disaster hardly affected the people in his region at all. His admirable methods were then adopted across the land, and the fame of this good and wise man spread even more than had that of the first young man. Indeed, he was soon elected governor of the whole nation. The first young man then understood that the greatest fame and wisdom is that which is born from the very things we do in life, from the impact they have on others, and from the need to improve ourselves every day. He never again took part in competitions or vain shows, and from then on, whenever he travelled, he took his books along with him, so he would be ready always to offer a helping hand to all.

This time, the ant stopped working long enough to say, "If you can call that advice at all."The spider became furious and screamed incomprehensible gibberish at the ant. The next day, as the ant came in, she was surprised to hear a reluctant greeting from the spider. The spider was equally surprised by how fast the ant worked when he didn\'t insult her, and instead, muttered things like "Keep it up," "Great job," Or "Just a little more".

['There was once a man who went out to look for a job. As he was passing his neighbour\'s house, an important piece of paper fell out of the man\'s pocket. His neighbour happened to be looking out the window. He saw the piece of paper fall, and he thought: "What a disgrace! that guy deliberately let that fall out of his pocket. he\'s trying to mess up the front of my house, and he\'s being sneaky about it, too!" But instead of going out and saying something, the neighbour planned his revenge. That night, he took his waste-paper basket and went to the man\'s house. The first man also happened to be looking out the window, and saw what happened. Later, when he was picking up the papers which had been dumped on his porch, he found the important piece of paper that he had lost. It was torn into dozens of pieces. He thought that his neighbour had not only picked his pocket, but had had the cheek to mess up his doorway with rubbish. He didn\'t want to say anything. Instead, he started plotting his revenge. That night he phoned a farmer to make an order of ten pigs and a hundred ducks. He asked that they be delivered to his neighbour\'s house. Of course, the next day, his neighbour had quite a bit of trouble trying to rid himself of so many animals and their accompanying pong.

They continued trying to get their own back on each other, and each time their acts of revenge got bigger and more ridiculous. The dropping of that single piece of paper ended up invoking a rock band, a fire siren, the driving of a lorry into a garden fence, the throwing of a hail of stones at windows, the firing of a canon, and finally the dropping of a bomb which destroyed both men\'s houses. Both ended up in a hospital, and had to spend quite some time sharing a room there. At first they refused to speak to each other, but, one day, tired of the silence, they got to talking. As time passed, they became friends, until one day they finally dared discuss the piece of paper incident. They realised that it had all been a misunderstanding, and that if they had talked to each other on the first occasion - instead of jumping to conclusions about bad intentions - then none of this would have happened.

['There was once a farmer who devised a competition between his dog and his rabbit. He made a hole in one of his biggest fields, and hid a carrot and a bone in it. He wanted to see which animal would find them first. The rabbit was very cheerful and optimistic, and he threw himself into looking for the carrot, digging here and there, totally convinced that he would find it. But the dog was pessimistic, and after sniffing around for a bit, he lay down on the ground and began to complain how difficult it was to find one bone in such a big field. The rabbit dug for hours, and with every new hole the dog complained even more about how difficult this was, even for the rabbit. The rabbit, on the other hand, thought that each hole dug was one hole less that needed digging. When there was no place in the whole field left to dig, the rabbit dug a tunnel to right under where the dog had been lying all that time. There he found the carrot and the bone. And this is how it was that the dog lost due to his pessimism. Because, thanks to his great instinct, he had already found the right place at the very beginning!

['The magi-virus was the first ever magical virus. It was an enchantment that passed from person to person: all you needed was two men, women, children, or old folk to touch each other, and the virus would spread from one to another. The effects of this spell varied according to the disease, but they usually took the form of small magical misfortunes, such as becoming suddenly bald, sneezing out ice cubes, crying out of your feet, or having such sticky hands that it was impossible to let go of anything you\'d picked up. It being the case that not everyone touches others with the same frequency, it so happened that some people passed on the magic illness very easily, but others - those with less contact with people - became really seriously ill, particularly when they\'d spent more than three days with the virus. Of course, no-one thought these small misfortunes were caused by a virus, and the blame was usually pinned on some mischievous elf or passing witch. Only one doctor from that area - dr. Ivor malady - , began suspecting something, after having contracted the illness over twenty times himself, and almost always after doing his rounds. He began experimenting on his patients and on himself, and within a few days he was certain about how the disease was transmitted. The good doctor called all the townsfolk to a meeting and told them that their illness would last for as long as it took them to touch someone else. And so it was that the town became the world chasing capital. Residents spent much of their time chasing others around the streets, to touch their chosen victim, in order to get rid of the virus. Even the oldest folk joined in the fun, and the people\'s health improved so much with all the running about that dr. Malady was presented with many prizes and awards. The funniest thing is that the magi-virus moved towns without anyone realising it. It was taken away by a man who came to visit, and bumped into a "Carrier" Who was sprinting after some children. On returning to his home town, things were a bit different, and instead of chase, that town became world hugging capital. Everyone who passed that way was given a great big bear hug, along with the magic illness. So it didn\'t take long for the virus to move on to another town, and in this third town the people ended up spending all hours of the day kissing each other. And so it was, one after another, the magi-virus went around the world, changing people\'s behaviour wherever it went, making every place more fun and more friendly, leaving everyone feeling closer. Such is the effect that no-one minds whether the virus has remained there or moved on, because all are enchanted by the changes it brings.

However, the last of the ladybirds was late in getting back. They waited for him for three days, and when he finally returned, he was downcast and embarrassed. He hadn't managed to reach the lake. Everyone criticised him for his slowness and stupidity, and they prepared to continue their journey the next day. Following their new guide, they spent a morning walking northwards until they reached some tall thick grassland, where they halted, astonished. In front of them was the great lake! But there were no crystal clear waters, or flowered meadows. The heavy rain had turned it into a huge green puddle surrounded by mud. Everyone understood what had happened. Without realising it, they had been swept beyond the lake by the flood. When the ladybirds had gone out looking for the lake, they had gone in the wrong direction. Now they could see that, apart from that one late ladybird, they had all wanted to be the great guide, and they had not had any qualms to lie in order to get what they wanted. And so, the late little ladybird, the only one who they now really trusted, was made the great guide. They also decided that every time one of them was discovered lying they would paint a black spot on that ladybird's back, so there'd be no way to erase it. Nor would a ladybird know how many spots they had on their back. From then on, when a ladybird looks at another's back, it can tell whether that ladybird is trustworthy. Likewise, when people show themselves to be dishonest other people paint spots on their impressions of them. It's enough to have just one black spot to change from a simple red insect into a ladybird. So, no matter what the prize may be, we should not allow anyone to paint that spot upon us.

['Clever clark\'s life in the school for cartoon characters was horrible. Clark was  a character from an ordinary comic, an intelligent kid, and that was it. But his classmates really were something special. Some were incredible superheroes, others were great wizards, or space travelers. And they all had such extraordinary powers that it made clark look like a simpleton. So spectacular were their abilities and adventures that the world of cartoon characters was a bit of a bore to them. -"What a pain this is," They would say, -"We always win here, and the villains are pitiful. we want real villains, so we can give them a taste of our powers!"All this unnerved clark. How would they face the real world, knowing how difficult it was? But his classmates got their way, and one day they all woke up in the real world. This world was really dangerous, and when the characters tried to save it - using their superpowers - they realised the real world was under some sort of spell. It must have been a terrible spell because everything seemed back to front. It was impossible to teleport from place to place, fly through the air, or use your laser vision. Any little knock or bump was terribly painful, space weapons didn\'t work, and none of the spells they knew had any effect. How could they save the world if their powers were useless? But then clark came along. It seemed like the spell had no effect on him, because he was just as intelligent as ever. He instantly understood what was going on. Along with clark there were other characters that hadn\'t lost their qualities. These were normal characters: boys and girls who were happy, fun, creative, charming, hard-working and affectionate… and they were able to live just the same in the real world as they had in the comic world. And while their \'powerful\' classmates could do nothing else but wonder what had happened to their powers, this new group of normal heroes put all their abilities into practice to help save the world from the current danger. And they were a great success, because the danger threatening the world was none other than the world filling up with children who spent their time doing nothing, expecting to be given some magical and mysterious power that would enable them to solve everything.

These words were expressed in his smile, his kindness, forbearance and charity.

['The frogs were tired of governing themselves. They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them, and they did nothing but sit around croaking in a bored manner and wishing for a government that could entertain them with the pomp and display of royalty, and rule them in a way to make them know they were being ruled. No milk and water government for them, they declared. So they sent a petition to jupiter asking for a king. Jupiter saw what simple and foolish creatures they were, but to keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge log, which fell into the water with a great splash. The frogs hid themselves among the reeds and grasses, thinking the new king to be some fearful giant. But they soon discovered how tame and peaceable king log was. In a short time the younger frogs were using him for a diving platform, while the older frogs made him a meeting place, where they complained loudly to jupiter about the government. To teach the frogs a lesson the ruler of the gods now sent a crane to be king of frogland. The crane proved to be a very different sort of king from old king log.

['Of all the stars that shine in the sky, there had always been one that was brighter and more beautiful than the others. The whole sky\'s planets and stars looked on in admiration, wondering what could be the important mission that this star was to carry out. And the star itself did exactly the same, aware of its own incomparable beauty. The speculation ended when a group of angels came to the star:   -"Hurry. your time has arrived, the lord calls upon you to carry out an important mission."And the star went as fast as he could and found out that her mission was to show where the most important event in history would take place. The star was filled with pride, and dressed herself in her most beautiful costume of glint and bedazzlement. She proceeded to follow the angels, who would show her the right place. The star shone with such strength and beauty that she was seen from all parts of the world, and so much so that a group of wise men decided to follow her, knowing that she must be pointing to something important. For days, the star followed the angels, showing the way, and she was eager to discover what place she was going to illuminate. However, when the angels stopped, and with great joy said "Here it is!" The star could not believe it. There were no palaces, no castles or mansions, no gold or jewels. Only a small, half-abandoned, dirty, smelly stable. -"Oh, no! not that! I can not waste my shine and beauty lighting up a place like this! I was born for something greater than this!"And though the angels tried to calm her, the star\'s fury grew and grew, and so much pride and arrogance bubbled up inside her that she began to burn. And thus she consumed herself and disappeared. Well, what a problem! There were only a few days left before the big moment, and they were without a star. The angels, in a panic, ran to heaven to tell god what had happened. After thinking for a moment, god said:   -"In that case, search for the the smallest, most humble and joyful of all the stars you can find, and bring it here."Surprised by the order, but unquestioning, because the lord often did this kind of thing, the angels flew through the heavens in search of the smallest, most joyful star. It was a tiny star, as small as a grain of sand. He knew so little that he gave no importance to his brightness, and he spent his whole time laughing and chatting with his friends, the biggest stars. When this star was brought to the lord, he was told:   -"The most perfect star in creation, the most wonderful, the most brilliant has failed due to its pride. I thought that you, the most humble and joyful of all the stars, should be the one chosen to take its place and light up the most important event in history: the birth of baby jesus in bethlehem."The star was filled with so much emotion and joy that he had already arrived over bethlehem, led by the angels, before he realised that his brilliance was negligible and that, however much he tried, he could not illuminate things much better than a firefly could. -"Ok," He said to himself. -"How come I didn\'t think before accepting this assignment? I\'m the smallest star there is! it is totally impossible for me to do as well as that great shining star … the shame of it! I\'m going to mess up an opportunity that all the stars in the heavens would have loved to have had …"Then he thought again, "All the stars in the heavens." Of course they would love to take part in something like this! And without hesitation, the start took to the skies with a message for all his friends:   -"On december 25th , at midnight, I want to share with you all the greatest glory that can exist for a star: to light up the birth of god! I will await you in the little town of bethlehem, by a small stable."And indeed, none of the stars rejected this generous invitation. So many stars joined together, that they formed the most beautiful star of christmas that would ever be seen, even though the little star couldn\'t even be seen amid all the brilliance. And happy at his excellent service, and as a reward for his humility and generosity, god transformed this little messenger into a beautiful shooting star, and gave him the gift of granting wishes every time saw his beautiful trail gleaming in the night sky was seen.

He knocked at the door several times, but no one answered. There was still a huge racket coming from inside, and the boy decided to just enter. When he opened the door there was total silence. Stepping inside, he saw thousands of shocked eyes looking back at him: vases, mirrors, paintings, chairs…  everything in that house was alive! And it was all looking at him!

['Anna dyatt was driving every doctor in the area mad. Her dad had a belly which he used to open doors with, and her mum was of similar proportions; but anna was a very slim and svelte girl. Anna had always been very picky about food. Her parents said she hardly ever ate the wonderful stews or fabulous pizzas made by her mother. Neither did she enjoy, as her father clearly did, all the delicious tarts and ice creams they would snack on every evening. When people asked her why she ate so little, anna would not know what to say; she only knew that she would prefer to have other things to eat. Naturally, everyone wondered who she had taken after…one day, anna went to see a new doctor. Although this new doctor was rather old, he looked fantastic; a lot different from those other doctors with fat bellies, who always looked so tired when they had to get up and walk anywhere. When anna\'s parents told the doctor about her problems with food, the doctor was very interested. He took them all to a dark, quiet room which contained a strange machine. The machine looked a bit like an old-fashioned speaker. -"Come here, anna, put this on," Said the doctor, as he put a helmet covered with lights and buttons, on her head. This helmet was connected to the machine by a few wires. When the helmet was on, the doctor left and came back with a plateful of fish. He placed it in front of anna, and cranked the machine up. Immediately, the machine started playing sounds of the sea: waves crashing on the shore, the relaxing sound of dolphin and whale calls… it was an enchanting music, and they listened to it for some time before the doctor again went out, and returned to replace the fish with a dish of fruit and vegetables. The sounds of the sea subsided, and in their place came the sound of breezes blowing through tree leaves, birdsong, and the sound of raindrops. Any of them could have happily spent hours listening to those soothing sounds of nature, but the doctor changed the plate again, and this time it was a dish full of meat. The machine started making more lively sounds; the sound of farm animals, crying and calling across fields and prairies. This wasn\'t as beautiful and relaxing as the previous sounds, but it was still quite pleasant and evocative. Then the doctor came into the room with an enormous, strong-smelling pizza, which really made anna\'s parents\' mouths water. When he set the dish down, the machine seemed to break down, and instead of some beautiful sound, out came a horrible din, like some accident in a shipyard. -"No, it hasn\'t broken. it\'s supposed to sound like that," The doctor reassured them. However, the noise was so disturbing, that the family had to ask the doctor to please change the type of food. The doctor came back with plate after plate: ice creams, sweets, burgers, candy… but they all provoked sounds which were equally as ugly as that of the pizza. So much so, that anna\'s parents asked the doctor to put the plate of fruit back there. -"What I\'m showing you both is that anna is not ill at all," Said the doctor, who could see that the parents were starting to understand. -"She has the gift of being able to mentally interpret each type of food\'s own signature tune. this music comes from where the food was born, raised, and prepared. it\'s entirely natural that anna would want to eat the foods whose music is most beautiful. and that\'s why she\'s so slim, healthy, and fit."Then the doctor told them all the marvellous story of that machine, which he had invented for himself. However, what most impressed mr and mrs dyatt was when they themselves put on the helmet and tried the machine. They too could generate the same kind of music which anna\'s mind had; except the volume was much lower. So anna\'s parents left the doctor\'s surgery ready, in future, to pay more attention to the barely audible music they heard inside when seeing food. And, from that day, in the dyatt house, pizzas, burgers, puddings, and ice creams were replaced by fruit, vegetables, and fish. These days, they all look fantastic, and if you meet a dyatt they\'ll be sure to ask you their favourite question:what did your dinner sound like today?

As with everything, some jobs were more interesting than others, and the children were eager to be given one of the best ones. When giving them out, the teacher took into account which pupils had been most responsible during the previous year, and those children were the ones who most looked forward to this day. Among them rita stood out. She was a kind and quiet girl; and during the previous year she had carried out the teacher\'s instructions perfectly. All the children knew rita was the favourite to be given the best job of all: to look after the class dog. But that year there was a big surprise. Each child received one of the normal jobs, like preparing the books or the radio for the lessons, telling the time, cleaning the blackboard, or looking after one of the pets. But rita\'s job was very different. She was given a little box containing some sand and one ant. And even though the teacher insisted that this ant was a very special ant, rita could not help feeling disappointed. Most of her classmates felt sorry for her. They sympathised with her, and remarked at how unfair it was that she had been given that job. Even her father became very angry with the teacher, and, as an act of protest, he encouraged rita to pay no attention to this insignificant pet. However, rita, who liked her teacher very much, preferred to show the teacher her error by doing something special with that job of such little interest. "I will turn this little task into something great," Rita said to herself. So it was that rita started investigating all about her little ant. She learned about the different species, and studied everything about their habitats and behaviour. She modified the little box to make it perfect for the ant. Rita gave the ant the very best food, and it ended up growing quite a bit bigger than anyone had expected…one day in spring, when they were in the classroom, the door opened, revealing a man who looked rather important. The teacher interrupted the class with great joy, and said,"This is doctor martinez. he has come to tell us a wonderful piece of news, isn\'t that right?" "Exactly". Said the doctor. "Today they have published the results of the competition, and this class has been chosen to accompany me, this summer, on a journey to the tropical rainforest, where we will be investigating all kinds of insects. among all the schools of this region, without doubt it is this one which has best cared for the delicate little ant given to you. congratulations! you will be wonderful assistants!" That day the school was filled with joy and celebration. Everyone congratulated the teacher for thinking of entering them in the competition, and they thanked rita for having been so patient and responsible. And so it was that many children learnt that to be given the most important tasks you have to know how to be responsible even in what are apparently the smallest tasks. And without doubt, it was rita who was most pleased at this, having said to herself so many times "I will turn this little job into something really great". ', 'Responsibility is to be measured by how we approach the seemingly less important tasks in life. ', 6]
['There was once a boy called mario who loved to have loads of friends. He showed off a lot, always talking about how many friends he had at school, and how he was so friendly with everyone. One day his grandfather said to him, -"Mario, I bet you a big bag of popcorn you don\'t have as many friends as you think. I\'m sure many of them are nothing more than companions, acquaintances, or partners in crime."Mario accepted the bet without hesitation. However, he wasn\'t sure how he could test whether or not his schoolmates were real friends, so he asked his grandpa. The old man answered, -"I have just exactly what you need, it\'s in the attic. wait here a minute." Grandpa left, soon returning as though carrying something in his hand, but mario could see nothing there. -"Take it. it\'s a very special chair. because it\'s invisible it\'s rather tricky to sit on, but if you take it to school and you manage to sit on it, you\'ll activate its magic and you\'ll be able to tell who your real friends are."Mario, brave and determined, took the strange invisible chair and set off for school. At break time he asked everyone to form a circle, and he put himself in the middle, with his chair. -"Nobody move. you\'re about to see something amazing." And mario attempted sitting on the chair. Having difficulty seeing it, he missed and fell straight onto his backside. Everyone had a pretty good laugh. -"Wait, wait, just a slight technical problem," He said, making another attempt. But again he missed the seat, causing more surprised looks, and a few cat calls. Mario wouldn\'t be beaten. He kept trying to sit on the magic chair, and kept falling to the ground… until, suddenly, he tried again and didn\'t fall. This time he sat, hovering in mid-air…then it was that he finally experienced the magic that his grandfather had been talking about. Looking around, mario saw george, lucas, and diana - three of his best friends - holding him up, so he wouldn\'t fall. Meanwhile, many others he had thought of as friends had done nothing but make fun of him, enjoying each and every fall. And there the show came to an end. Leaving with his three friends, he explained to them how his grandfather had so cleverly thought of a way to show him that true friends are those who care for us, and not just any acquaintance who happens to be passing by. Even less would a friend be someone who takes joy in our misfortunes. That evening the four children went to see mario\'s grandpa to pay out the bet. They had a great time listening to stories, and eating popcorn until fit to burst. And, from then on, they used the magic chair test on quite a few occasions. And whoever passed it became friends for life. ', 'Not everyone around us is a real friend. True friends take care of us. ', 6]
['Flora was a carnivorous plant, but truly in the meat-eating sense. She lived in a supermarket, next to her friend porky the butcher\'s counter. Porky treated her with great affection and attention, and always had some morsel of meat to give her at the end of each day. But one day, flora didn\'t get her ration of meat. Nor the next day, and she got so worried that she decided to spy on porky. What she found out was that he wasn\'t giving her anything because he was putting lots of big slabs of meat in a big yellow box. Pretending not to know anything about it, flora asked porky if she could have a little of the food kept in the yellow box. He responded very severely that she could not, and added,"Don\'t even think about it, flora! don\'t ever think about touching the meat in that box". The plant felt hurt, as well as hungry, and she couldn\'t stop wondering who porky was keeping all that delicious-looking meat for. With her negative thoughts she was filling up with anger. That very night, when the shop was empty, she went over to the box, opened it, and ate that meat until her belly ached…the next morning, when porky arrived and discovered the theft, flora felt terrible. He asked her several times whether she had taken the meat. At first she denied it, but seeing porky\'s worry and nerves she decided to confess. "What have you done? you reckless thing!" Porky exploded, "I told you not to touch it! all that meat was poisoned!! that\'s why I haven\'t been able to give you anything for days. they sent us a spoiled delivery…"Without delay, they found a pharmabotanovet, with a greenhouse-hospital, who managed to save flora\'s life. She was already feeling great pain in her roots, and her leaves were changing colour. The shock hit everyone hard, but at least flora learnt to stick to the rules set by those who most love us. That\'s much safer than just doing whatever you want. ', 'Behind the rules laid out by those who love us lies a desire to help us and protect us, even though it might not seem so to us. ', 6]
['One day, miss ellis gave her pupils a new assignment: an assignment on happiness. Her pupils would be "Happiness collectors", and were to see what would happen when they tried to bring happiness to those around them. As part of their assignment, all the students did really delightful, wonderful things, but what carla chalmers did left everyone gobsmacked. Several days after the assignment had been handed out, carla turned up carrying a big sack. "Here in this bag I have all the happiness I\'ve collected so far," She said, smiling. On seeing this, everyone was filled with expectation, but carla didn\'t want to show anyone what was in the sack. Instead, she pulled out a small box and gave it to her teacher. When miss ellis had taken the box, carla took an instant camera out of her own pocket and stood with it at the ready. "Open it, miss ellis."The teacher slowly opened the box and looked inside. A big smile shone on her face, and at that moment carla snapped a photo. Carla\'s photo popped out the camera, and she offered it to miss ellis along with a sheet of paper. The teacher read the paper in silence, and when she had finished she gestured over at the sack. "Oh, so it\'s….""Yes!" Interrupted carla, undoing the knot which sealed the sack, "It\'s a great big pile of smiles!"She opened the sack and hundreds of photos fell out, all of different smiles, each one of them beautiful. The rest of the class tried to work out how carla had managed to create such a great big chain of happiness. All there was in the box was a photo of a big smile. But everyone who had seen it had felt happiness being transmitted to them, and in return, without even thinking about it, every person had responded with a smile of their own. With all her classmates now smiling, carla took a photo of each one of them. She gave them their own photo along with a slip of paper, which asked them to do the same with other people, and to send a copy of the photos to her home address. And for months afterwards, carla\'s post box was always full to the brim with photos of happy, smiling people. And so it was that she managed to spread understanding of the simple truth that every time you smile you are sending a gift to the world.

['Andy never wanted to go to bed on time. His parents had explained to him how important it was to go to bed early and get a good rest. But andy paid no attention to them, and they didn\'t know what to do. That was, until one weekend when they were visiting andy\'s grandparents. Grandpa peter heard all about it and said: "This sounds like a job for tubby, my pot-bellied cat". They loaded the cat onto the car and returned home. Tubby was a slow, inflated-looking kind of a cat. He wasn\'t much of a bother because most of the time no one knew where he was. That night, at bedtime, the same problem arose. Andy had no intention of going to bed, and even though his parents waited a while to see if tubby would solve the problem, nothing happened. "Grandpa really does make up some nonsense", said andy\'s father, "I really think he\'s starting to lose it". Hours later, andy finally decided to go to bed. But what a surprise when he entered his bedroom! Tubby was in his bed, totally sprawled out, pot-belly in the air, and snoring like an express train. Andy tried to shift the cat, but there was no way of moving him an inch. That night he hardly slept a wink, being pushed over into one tiny corner of his bed. The next day the same thing happened, even though andy was much more tired from not having slept. When the third day arrived, he had understood that if he wanted to sleep in his bed, he would have to get into it before tubby did. That night, when his parents merely started hinting at the topic of bedtime, andy shot upstairs like a bullet, and dived into bed. His parents could not believe it. They knew nothing about tubby in the bed, nor did they understand why andy went to bed on time, without complaint. They were so happy about this that they stayed up quite late, celebrating, but… … can you guess where tubby slept that night? ', 'Funny story which encourages children to go to bed early. ', 6]
['Once upon a time, in a small country, people decided to investigate what it was that parents really liked the most. A competition was organised. It would use the latest invention of professor crank-shafte: the gladometer. To date, the gladometer is the only contraption ever built capable of measuring joy and happiness. So, one by one, the children demonstrated their own particular talents to their parents. And the gladometer faithfully measured their parents\' reactions. One boy turned up with a trained pig; the pig sang and danced. A girl came and played the violin like an angel, and an intelligent boy came and read his very big book. The parent\'s happiness was plain to see. Finally, a boy came to the gladometer carrying nothing. Nor did he know how to do anything. When the organisers asked him what he was going to do, he simply said:"I am very obedient."This said, the machine measured such a high reading that it began violently vibrating, and finally exploded. The boy who had done nothing won all the prizes that day, for solving the mystery of what pleases parents the most. ', 'Parents value obedience the most. ', 6]
["Many, many years ago everyone was strong and healthy. They ate a very varied diet, and especially loved fruit, vegetables, and fish. Everyone took daily exercise, and they enjoyed themselves playing and leaping about. The earth was the healthiest place you could imagine, and it was clear that both adults and children were full of joy and good moods. All that made the dark witches furious. They only ever wanted to do harm and make problems for people. The worst of all of these witches was sourface; she was evil, and could be relied on to come up with the nastiest ideas. She suggested that all the witches combine their energies to invent a potion which would take away people's desire to live happily. So, one night, all the witches gathered down in the swampy forest and worked together on that evil spell. The spell was so powerful, and would need so much energy to cast, that when one of the witches got one of the words wrong, there was a huge explosion. So big was the explosion, that it completely destroyed the forest. It turned all those evil witches into tiny little creatures, like germs, and left them trapped in a green liquid inside a small glass bottle, which lay lost in the swamp. There they were trapped for centuries, until one day a little boy found the bottle. Thinking it contained some kind of soft drink, he drank the lot. The evil, microscopic witches took advantage of this situation, and even though they were tiny and couldn't hurt anyone, they soon learned to change the little boy's likes and dislikes in order to get him to do what they wanted. In a few days, a funny feeling in his mouth and tongue meant the boy no longer wanted to eat vegetables, fruit, or fish. All he wanted to do was eat ice cream, pizza, burgers, and candy. Then a nibbling feeling all over his body meant he no longer enjoyed playing and running about with his friends. All that stuff tired him out; he now just wanted to stay in the house, sitting or lying about. So, his life got more and more boring, he started feeling ill, and before long he had no desire to do anything. The evil potion had worked! And the worst thing of all was that the witches learned to jump from one person to another, like a virus. They managed to turn the influence of the potion into the most contagious of diseases: the disease of wasting your life. It was a long while before, with the help of his microscope, doctor fitton-helthie discovered that the little witches were causing all this disease. There was no vaccine or cough mixture to get rid of them, but the good doctor discovered that the witches could not stand joy and good humour. It turned out that the best cure was to make a strong effort to live a healthy, joyful, and happy life. When a person became healthy, the little witches would leave that body as soon as they could, riding off on a sneeze. From then on, the best remedy was not pills or injections, but just a little bit of effort to eat some fruit, vegetables, and fish, and to do some exercise. And whoever came to see doctor fitton-helthie, and took his advice, ended up totally well, being cured of the waste-of-life disease. ", 'Although you have to make some effort to live a healthy and happy life, it pays to eat a little of everything, and do some exercise. ', 6]
['Once upon a time, there was a painting spider, one of those artistic species of spider, that live in the basements of museums and galleries. They live there alongside paintings left and forgotten for years; certainly a suitable place to spin the most impressive of webs. Our spider spun the best webs in the whole museum, and his house was really spectacular. All his efforts went into looking after the web, which he considered to be the most valuable in the world. However, as time went on, the museum set about reorganising its paintings, and it started making space upstairs to put some of the basement paintings on display. Many of the basement spiders realised what was happening, and were cautious about it, but our spider paid it no mind:    -"Doesn\'t matter," He would say, -"It\'ll just be a few paintings."More and more paintings were removed from the basement, but the spider carried on reinforcing his web, -"Where am I going to find a better place than this?" He would say. That was, until early one morning when, too quick for him to react, they took his own painting, along with the spider and his web. The spider realised that just for not having wanted to lose his web, he was now going to end up in the exhibition room. In an act of strength and decisiveness, he chose to abandon his magnificent web, the web he had worked his whole life to build up. And it\'s a good job he did so, because that way he saved himself from the insect killer they were spraying on the paintings up in the exhibition room. In his escape, after overcoming many difficulties, the spider ended up in a secluded little garden, where he found such a quiet corner that there he was able to spin an even better web, and became a much happier spider.

['There was once a boy who - although very good and obedient - hated eating cabbage. Whenever he had to eat it he would complain and get extremely angry. One day, his mother decided to send him to the market to buy… a cabbage! So the boy was, of course, disgusted at this turn of events. At the market, the boy reluctantly purchased one, but this wasn\'t just any old cabbage. It happened to be a cabbage which hated children. After an enormous argument, the boy and the cabbage set off for home, in silence, their anger barely below the surface the whole time. On the way, while crossing the river, the boy slipped and both of them fell into the rapids and were pulled under by the current. With great effort, they managed to come to the surface, grab onto a plank of wood, and stay afloat. They had to spend so much time together, adrift on that plank, that after becoming mightily bored, they ended up conversing. They got to know each other, and became friends. They played many bizarre games, like the fish without a rod, the tiny hiding place, and the king of the mountain. Chatting with his new friend, the boy understood the importance, at his young age, of vegetables like the cabbage, and how wrong it is to always be bad-mouthing them. The cabbage, for his part, realised that sometimes his flavour was a touch strong, and strange to children. So they agreed that when they reached home, the boy would treat the cabbage with great respect, and the cabbage would do its best to taste like spaghetti. Their agreement was nothing if not a great success. The boy\'s mother was greatly surprised at how willingly he ate the cabbage, and the boy prepared the best hiding place in his tummy for the cabbage, shouting "Mmm! what great spaghetti!"

Gardener replied to king, "My lord.. if you give me some bee\'s honey than I could even bring him into the palace..!!"So king ordered that he must be given as much honey as he wanted. Gardener knew that this particular deer loved to eat flowers and fruits in king\'s garden. So, gardener started to let himself be seen by that deer little by little, so that deer would be less frightened. Then he began to smear honey on grass where deer usually came to eat. Soon, deer began eating honey smeared grass. So, he developed craving for taste of this honey-grass. This craving made him come to garden everyday. Before long he would eat nothing else. .! Little by little, gardener came closer and closer to deer. At first deer would run away but later he lost his fear and came to think the man was harmless. As gardener became more and more friendly, eventually he got deer to eat honey-grass right out of his hand. Gardener continued this for sometime in order to build up confidence and trust. Meanwhile, gardener had set up row of curtains, making a wide path from far end of garden pleasure to king\'s palace. Curtains would keep deer from seeing any people that might scare him. When all was prepared, gardener took a bag of grass and container of honey with him. When deer came, he began to feed deer by his hands. Slowly, he continued to lead him with honey grass through curtained pathway right into the palace. Once inside, palace guards closed the doors and wind deer was trapped. Seeing so many people in palace, deer suddenly became frightened and began running around madly, trying to escape. King came down to hall and saw panic stricken deer and said, "What a wind deer!! how could he have gotten into such state? ordinarily, if wind deer get even little bit frightened at particular place, he will not return to that place for rest of his life and will not return to a place where he has seen human for consecutive seven day.but look!! even such a shy wild creature can be enslaved by his cravings for taste of something sweet. which lured it into palace."Not wishing any harm to deer, king had him released into forest. Deer never returned to pleasure garden and never missed taste of honey grass again. ', "It's better to eat to live than to live to eat. ", 6]

['Long, long ago, when the world was so full of magic that even the smallest stone could hold a thousand secrets, there was a palace that was alive. Because it slept all the time, nobody knew its secret. It remained that way until the princess who lived there married a prince who was a brave and strong warrior but had such a bad temper that even the smallest inconvenience would cause him to hurl things around and slam doors and windows. After his last victory, he let the kind and sweet princess leave the palace to travel and negotiate the peace, leaving the prince to live alone for a long time. The prince\'s boredom caused his bad temper to grow worse and, with the passing days, more and more marks and dents appeared on the walls and floors of the palace, which grew dirty and neglected. One day, when the prince went out, the palace - annoyed at how it was being treated - woke up and moved for the first time in many years. It decided to hide behind a hill but was so big that it didn\'t take long for the prince to find it again. The palace tried to escape many times but the prince would always find it easily and then unleash his fury, causing more and more damage. One night, having grown tired of the prince\'s actions, the palace locked all its doors and windows while the prince slept. It ran for days and days, ignoring the damage and destruction the prince was causing while trapped inside. When the palace finally stopped and opened its doors, the prince discovered that they were surrounded by ice and snow, in the midst of the most horrible cold. "The north pole? how do I get out of here?" Wondered the prince as he explored his new surroundings. After searching all morning and finding nothing, the prince decided to go back to the palace to warm up. However, when he tried to open the door he found it locked. He banged on the door furiously but all he managed to do was destroy his near-frozen hands. After a while, the door opened slightly and the prince ran towards it, only for it to slam in his face. "Stupid palace! it seems angry with me!"The palace was indeed angry with the prince and shook all its windows to let him know. "So that\'s the way you want it?" Shouted the prince. "Well, get ready, because this is war. and I have never lost a battle."In the days that followed, the prince and the palace had the strangest fight imaginable. While the prince tried to get in by breaking the windows, the palace did whatever it could to keep him out. In the middle of that crazy war, the cold began to freeze the prince\'s feet and crack the palace walls. When he was almost completely frozen solid, the prince - winner of a thousand battles - realised that the only way to win this one would be to make peace. And so the prince began to repair the palace and to control his anger and fury so as not to damage it again. The palace soon realised that it liked the repairs much more than the stupid fighting and that only that brutish prince could do them. Soon enough, the palace opened its doors to allow the prince to shelter from the cold at night, and clean and repair by day. Much to his surprise, the prince discovered that he really enjoyed doing the repairs and in no time the palace looked magnificent once again. So much so, that one night it finally forgave the prince, closed its doors and ran all the way back to its country. They arrived just before the princess, who was delighted with the state of the palace and the improved character of her husband, now barely interested in wars and fighting any more. The lasting peace and the prince\'s repairs meant the palace could finally resume its silent sleep. The only thing anyone knows about this unique palace is that it was taken down stone by stone and distributed around the world. Some of the stones could well be part of your house today, so don\'t let your anger and temper cause it any damage… ', 'When we give in to anger, we end up doing damage to the things or people closest to us who we should really take care of.

['At the deepest depths of the great mountain, in a huge labyrinth of tunnels created by the great wizards, there lived - imprisoned - the worst of beasts, a horrible creature who all knew as kraton. He had been put there after terrorising the local population. It was a magic labyrinth with only one entrance and exit which changed its position every day. But it so happened that there arrived in that land a man of wicked heart, nasty to the extreme, and his only wish was to rule over all the king\'s people. His name was jafa, and he was in such a hurry to fulfil his desire that, on hearing of the kraton, he thought of liberating it to help him with his plans, no matter how dangerous the monster was. So, jafa travelled to the great mountain accompanied by all his slaves. There were many of them, and they were so afraid of their master that they didn\'t take long to find the entrance to the labyrinth. One of these slaves, a very wise man, found out how to know the location of the exit each day, from outside, once jafa was inside the mountain. -"Only one thing more, my lord," Said the slave after explaining the system, -"When you\'re going to exit from the labyrinth, you should wait until it\'s nighttime. be sure not come out during daylight…"And not wanting to hear any more, jafa entered the labyrinth. From out of a great darkness, jafa started calling for the monster, explaining to the monster his intentions. Jafa would free him from the labyrinth if, in return, kraton would be at jafa\'s service, terrorising the people there for at least ten years. The monster shouted his agreement with jafa\'s plan, since all he wanted to do was escape the labyrinth and wreak his revenge. After several days they found each other amid the blackest darkness, and there they cemented their terrible pact. Following the system recommended by jafa\'s slave, they soon found the way out. On approaching it, brilliant sunlight played upon the exit. Jafa remembered his slave\'s words. Filled with impatience, the wicked jafa sat down to wait, but the beast, seeing itself free at last, didn\'t want to listen to talk of waiting, and forgetting their agreement kraton ran out of the labyrinth. From inside, jafa heard kraton\'s terrible screams of agony. He was scared, but also needed to go and see what had happened to the beast. And though he still remembered his slave\'s words, he decided to go out. As soon as it touched jafa\'s face, the sunlight and the light of a thousand mirrors that the wise slave had placed around the exit to illuminate that spot, entered jafa\'s eyes. Eyes that, due to the darkness they had been in for days, were defenceless to the light, and duly burned out, leaving the impatient jafa blind for the rest of his days, as had happened to the kraton just moments earlier. And so, both evil beings, blind, clumsy and impatient, could not even see how their plans had come apart, and remained punished for ever in a life of darkness, along with other creatures of the night.

['This is the story of a long-gone era. In the country of india, nearly five\xa0thousand years back, lived a boy named eklavya, the son of a tribal chief in the\xa0forests of the kingdom- hastinapura. Eklavya was a brave, handsome boy. He was\xa0loved by all. But he was not happy. His father saw that something troubled eklavya. More than once he found his son\xa0lost deep in thought when other boys enjoyed the pleasures of hunting and\xa0playing. One day the father asked his son, why are you so unhappy, eklavya? Why\xa0don t you join your friends? Why are you not interested in hunting? Father, I want to be an archer replied eklavya, I want to become a disciple of\xa0the great dronacharya, the great tutor of archery in hastinapura. His gurukul is\xa0a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors. Eklavya saw his father was silent. He continued, father, I know that we belong\xa0to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. So\xa0please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of dronacharya. \xa0eklavya\'s father was troubled, for he knew that his son\'s ambition was not an\xa0easy one. But the chief was a loving father and he did not want to refuse his\xa0only son\'s wish. So the kind man gave his blessings and sent his son on his way\xa0to drona s gurukul. \xa0eklavya set on his way. Soon he reached the part of the forest where drona\xa0taught the princes of hastinapur. In those days, there was no such system as a school, college, university or\xa0hostel. The only place where one could get some education was a gurukul. A\xa0gurukul  is a type of ancient hindu\xa0school in india that is residential in nature with the shishyas or students and\xa0the guru or teacher living in proximity, many a time within the same house. The\xa0gurukul is the place where the students resided together as equals, irrespective\xa0of their social standing. The students learned from the guru and also helped the\xa0guru in his day-to-day life, including the carrying out of mundane chores such\xa0as washing clothes, cooking, etc. The education imparted thus, was a wholesome\xa0one. Having said this much, let us now return to eklavya. When the boy reached\xa0dronacharya s gurukul, he saw that it consisted of a group of huts, \xa0surrounded\xa0by trees and an archery yard. The disciples were practicing to shoot arrows with\xa0their bows and arrows in the yard. It was an engaging sight. But eklavya s eyes\xa0searched drona. Where was he? Will he be able to see the man? Without drona, all\xa0his purpose of coming here would be meaningless. But all his worries soon\xa0subsided. He did not have to wait for long. There was the man standing near a\xa0tree busy instructing a boy, who was none else than the third pandava prince\xa0arjuna, as eklavya came to know later. Though eklavya had never seen drona\xa0before, he put his guess at work. He went near drona and bowed. The sage was\xa0surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? He asked. "Dronacharya, I am eklavya, son of the tribal chief in the western part of the\xa0forests of hastinapura." Eklavya replied. "Please accept me as your disciple and\xa0teach me the wonderful art of archery."Drona sighed. "Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a shudra, the\xa0lowest social community according to the vedic caste system. I am a brahmin, the\xa0highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a shudra boy" He said. "And he\'s also a royal teacher," Interrupted prince arjuna. "Our guru has been\xa0appointed by the king to train us, the princes and the highborn. how dare you\xa0come inside the gurukul and seek him? leave! now!" He spat out, looking enraged\xa0that eklavya had disturbed his practice. Eklavya was stunned at arjuna\'s behavior. He himself was the son of the chief of\xa0his clan, but he never insulted anyone below him in such a way. He looked at\xa0drona for some kind of support, but the sage remained silent. The message was\xa0loud and clear. Dronacharya also wanted him to leave. He refused to teach him. \xa0the innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by drona\'s refusal to teach him. "It\'s\xa0not fair!" He thought miserably. "God has given knowledge to all, but man alone\xa0differentiates his kind."He left the place with a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth. But it\xa0could not shatter his ambition to learn archery. He was still as determined to\xa0learn archery. \xa0"I may be a shudra but does it make any difference?" Thought he. " I am as\xa0strong and zealous as drona\'s princes and disciples. if I practice the art\xa0every day, I can surely become an archer."Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a\xa0statue of dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place\xa0it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before\xa0his guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his guru shunned him, he\xa0still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and\xa0started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed eklavya\xa0the mere tribal hunter into eklavya the extraordinary archer. Eklavya became an\xa0archer of exceptional prowess, superior even to drona\'s best pupil, arjuna. One day while eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first, the boy\xa0ignored the dog, but the\xa0continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He\xa0stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking. \xa0before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, eklavya fired seven arrows\xa0in rapid succession to fill the dog\'s mouth without injuring it. As a result, it\xa0roamed the forests with its mouth opened. But eklavya was not alone in his practice. He was unaware of the fact that just\xa0some distance away, the pandava princes were also present in that area of the\xa0forest. As fate would have it, that day, they had come with their teacher, drona,\xa0who was instructing them about some finer points of archery by making them learn\xa0in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the "Stuffed" Dog, and\xa0wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too. " \xa0such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer." He exclaimed. He told\xa0the pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be\xa0met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for\xa0the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in\xa0black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was\xa0eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. "Your aim is truly remarkable!" Drona praised eklavya, and asked, "From whom did\xa0you learn archery?" Eklavya was thrilled to hear drona\'s praises. \xa0how surprised\xa0he will be if he told drona that he, in fact, was his guru! "From you my master. \xa0you are my guru," Eklavya replied humbly. "Your guru? how can I be your guru? I have never seen you before!" Drona\xa0exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He\xa0remembered about an eager boy who had visited his gurukul several months ago. " \xa0now I remember," Said he. "Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused\xa0admission in my gurukul some months back?""Yes, dronacharya", replied the boy. "After I left your gurukul, I came home and\xa0made a statue like you and worshiped it every day. I practiced before your\xa0image. you refused to teach me, but your statue did not. thanks to it, I have become a good archer."Hearing this, arjuna became angry. "But you promised me that you\'d make me the\xa0best archer in the world!" He accused drona. "Now how can that be? now a common\xa0hunter has become better than me!"The other princes remembered their master frequently praising arjuna that he had\xa0immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with\xa0bated breath. What will their teacher do now? Unable to answer arjuna\'s question, drona remained silent. The sage too was\xa0upset that his promise to prince arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was\xa0also angry with eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish\xa0eklavya. \xa0"Where is your guru dakhsina? you have to give me a gift for your training," The\xa0sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make eklavya suffer for his\xa0disobedience. Eklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina was the voluntary fee or gift offered\xa0by a disciple to his guru at the end of his training. The guru-shishya\xa0parampara, I. E. The teacher-student tradition, was a hallowed tradition in hinduism. At the\xa0end of a shishya\'s study, the guru asks for a "Guru dakshina," Since a guru does\xa0not take fees. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru\xa0before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all. "Dronacharya, I\'ll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. ask me\xa0anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina "He said. "I might ask\xa0something you don\'t like to give me. what if you refuse the dhakshina I want?" \xa0drona asked cunningly. Eklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a\xa0guru\'s dakshina was refused. "No! how can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. \xa0I\'ll never refuse anything you ask, dronacharya," Promised the unsuspecting boy. Drona did not wait anymore. "Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as\xa0my guru dhakshina" He declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How\xa0could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy? For a moment eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb, he could never shoot\xa0arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. "Ok gurudev as you wish", said\xa0he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, eklavya drew out his knife and cut\xa0his thumb! \xa0the prince\xa0gasped at eklavya\'s act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed\xa0no signs of pain\xa0and held out his severed thumb to dronacharya. "Here is my guru dakshina, drona", ekalavya said. "I am happy that you have\xa0made me your disciple, even if I\'m a mere shudra hunter."The sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. "Eklavya,\xa0even without your thumb, you\'ll be known as a great archer. I bless you that\xa0you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru," Drona declared\xa0and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was\xa0content that his promise to arjuna was not broken. The gods blessed eklavya from\xa0above. But despite his handicap, eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he\xa0do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice,\xa0eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a\xa0greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When\xa0drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness. And true to drona\'s blessing, eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and\xa0brave student in the epic of mahabharata. ', "Any knowledge teacher gives to student has value in life of a student as he goes on with life. \xa0 think from kindergarten till highest level of study you have completed, see what you will be left with if there were no teachers in your life. \xa0 parents give us life, love and help in going right direction, but teachers show us how to live life, shows us path and makes us self dependable so that we can pick the right path. \xa0 always respect your teachers, do not value them any lesser than your parents. \xa0 when student succeeds in studies and life, its student who always gets praised by people, not the one who gave student a knowledge to success. \xa0\xa0 teacher's happiness is in student's success, and student should not forget to at least thank politely to the one who made you capable of following journey of life. \xa0 and if you had learned what your teacher taught you with dedication and respect to towards teacher, journey of life always gets comfortable.

['I will show to posterity, by a short story, that there is often more merit in one man than in a multitude. A person, at his death, left three daughters; one handsome, and hunting for the men with her eyes; the second, an industrious spinner of wool, frugal, and fond of a country life; the third, given to wine, and very ugly. Now the old man made their mother his heir, on this condition, that she should distribute his whole fortune equally among the three, but in such a manner that they should not possess or enjoy what was given them; and further, that as soon as they should cease to have the property which they had received, they should pay over to their mother a hundred thousand sesterces. The rumour spreads all over athens. The anxious mother consults the learned in the law. No one can explain in what way they are not to possess what has been given, or have the enjoyment of it; and then again, in what way those who have received nothing, are to pay money. After a long time had been wasted, and still the meaning of the will could not be understood, the parent, disregarding the strict letter of the law, consulted equity. For the wanton, she sets aside the garments, female trinkets, silver bathing-vessels, eunuchs, and beardless boys: for the worker in wool, the fields, cattle, farm, labourers, oxen, beasts of burden, and implements of husbandry: for the drinker, a store-room, well stocked with casks of old 413 wine, a finely finished house, and delightful gardens. When she was intending to distribute what was thus set apart for each, and the public approved, who knew them well; aesop suddenly stood up in the midst of the multitude, and exclaimed: "O! if consciousness remained to their buried father, how would he grieve that the people of athens are unable to interpret his will!"On this, being questioned, he explained the error of them all: "The house and the furniture, with the fine gardens, and the old wines, give to the worker in wool, so fond of a country life. the clothes, the pearls, the attendants, and other things, make over to her who spends her life in luxury. the fields, the vines, and the flocks, with the shepherds, present to the wanton. not one will be able to retain possession of what is alien to her taste. the ungainly one will sell her wardrobe to procure wine; the wanton will part with the lands to procure fine clothes; and she who delights in cattle, and attends to her spinning, will get rid of her luxurious abode at any price. thus, no one will possess what was given, and they will pay to their mother the sum named from the price of the things, which each of them has sold."

['Once upon a time there was a giant bathtub that had been dumped in the middle of the forest. It was the perfect home for all types of little insects. They had to be careful of just one thing while living there: to ensure the plughole remained free from obstruction because otherwise they might all drown if rain fell suddenly. The burly beetles were put in charge of keeping an eye on the plughole to make sure that it was never blocked. However, one day disaster struck. The plughole was blocked by something huge, something gigantic - a watermelon! The watermelon was so big that not even the biggest beetle, not even the five biggest, could shift it. In fact, it was so big that not even all of the beetles working together could move the watermelon from the plughole! All the strongest insects tried their very best to move the watermelon but couldn\'t budge it even the tiniest bit. The smartest insects then tried to use their brains to come up with a way to move the watermelon but they had no luck either. Eventually, the wisest insects started to plan the escape from the bathtub. Amidst all the sadness, a ridiculous foreign ant had the cheek to ask if she could take the watermelon away with her. Very funny, indeed! It took a lot of insects to calm the beetles down and stop them from crushing the funny little ant. But the ant wasn\'t joking at all! At the end of the day, she returned, this time with thousands upon thousands of other ants. In perfect order, each ant went up to the watermelon, bit off a piece and walked off with it. "You\'re not going to get anywhere by doing that" Said a grasshopper to one ant that stopped for a second to rest. "The watermelon is exactly the same as it was before you bit your piece off!""Hmmm, are you sure about that?" The ant responded in a funny accent, as if it had never occurred to her. Then, without giving it another thought, she resumed her journey. However, that little piece must have had an effect. Just a few days later, there was not a single trace of the giant watermelon. From that day on, many of the most difficult jobs in the bathtub became small ones that were easier to carry out little by little.

["A long, long time ago, before people and their cities filled the earth, even before many things even had a name, there was a mysterious place that was guarded by the fairy of the lake. Fair and generous, each of her followers were ever willing to serve her. There was a time in which some evil beings threatened the lake and its surrounding forests, and the fairy's followers joined her on a dangerous journey across rivers, swamps and deserts in search of the crystal stone, their only hope of being saved. The fairy warned them of the dangers and difficulties that lay ahead, of how hard it would be to endure the whole journey, but none of her followers were afraid. They all promised to accompany her to wherever it was needed, and that same day the fairy and her fifty most loyal followers set out on their journey. As it turned out, the voyage was even harder and more terrible than the fairy had imagined and warned them about. They were met by terrifying beasts. They had to march day and night, lost in deserts, hungry and thirsty. Faced by such adversity, many followers lost heart and abandoned the quest. Finally, only one remained, and his name was shadow. Shadow was by no means the bravest, he was not the best fighter, nor was he the most quick-witted or the most fun. However, what he did do was stay loyal to the fairy, right to the very end. Whenever the fairy asked shadow why he had not done as the others and simply abandoned her, shadow would always say, 'I told you I would follow you in spite of all difficulties, and that is what I am doing. I am not going to turn my back on you just because the journey has been hard. 'thanks to her loyal shadow, the fairy finally managed to find the crystal stone. Unfortunately, there was a monster guarding the stone, and this monster was not about to give up the stone easily. At this, shadow, in a final act of loyalty, offered himself in exchange for the stone. The monster accepted, and so shadow spent the rest of his days in the monster's service. The powerful magic of the crystal stone meant that the fairy could return to the lake and make the evil beings disappear. But every night she would cry at the absence of her loyal shadow, because from shadow's act of self-sacrifice had arisen a love stronger than any other. And in memory of shadow, and to show everyone the value of loyalty and commitment, the fairy presented every being on earth with its own shadow during the day; but when nighttime comes all these shadows travel to the lake, to spend time with the sad fairy, and to try to console her for her loss.

['Albert was mad about computers and video games. He could spend hours and hours in front of the screen, and even though his parents found it hard to believe, he really enjoyed every minute of it. He hardly left his seat. When people encouraged him to get involved with normal life, he would respond:    -"This is my doorway to the world, there is much more here than you realise."Among all his games there was one he especially liked. In it he would move a character around, collecting turtles on an infinity of levels and screens. He was a real expert at it. Maybe there was no one else in the world who had collected as many turtles as he had, but, nevertheless, albert still wanted more and more and more…one day, when he got home from school, everything had changed. As usual, as soon as he arrived, he ran to his room to switch the computer on. But this time he heard some strange noises, like breaking glass. Suddenly the screen broke, and from inside came dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of little turtles. And they filled every square inch of his bedroom. Albert was stunned. He couldn\'t believe what was happening. But after pinching himself, he shut down and started the computer up many times, and called to his parents to see if he was dreaming this. As it happens, he had to accept that on that day something very strange was happening. On entering, his parents put their heads in their hands. Seeing that the turtles were staying in albert\'s room, they decided to make them his responsibility. Looking after thousands of turtles, day after day, was no easy task. Over the following days albert set himself to learning all he could about turtles. He studied their diet, their habits, and he began to think up ways to feed them. He also tried to trick them into leaving his room, but it never worked. Gradually, he got used to living among turtles, and actually began to enjoy it. He liked playing with them, showing them tricks, and calling them by their names. This despite the fact that feeding them and cleaning up after them hardly left him with any free time. And everyone, including his parents, his friends, and his teachers, enjoyed hearing albert\'s stories and his growing knowledge about nature. Finally, the day arrived when albert forgot about his beloved computer. He now much preferred living with his turtles, learning about them and watching the way they interacted. He went out into the countryside to see how they lived there. He felt happy that they were part of his world. That same day, just as quickly as they had arrived, the turtles disappeared. On finding out, his parents worried that he would return to his video games, and go back to being grumpy, but that didn\'t happen. Albert didn\'t shed a tear. Nor did he waste a second looking for the turtles amongst the cables and chips of his computer. Instead, he emptied his savings from his piggybank and shot straight down to the pet shop. He returned with a turtle, and some other animal he wanted to look after and learn about. And even today albert is still learning and discovering new things about animals and nature.

["You know, they reckon ken the wizard and clive the magician had one of the best flea collections in world history. Those fleas were the cleverest, liveliest, strongest fleas of their era, and most useful for all sorts of spells. Ken and clive never went anywhere without at least a thousand fleas on them, always kept safely in one of their bizarre glass bags, so that everyone could appreciate the fleas' special qualities. One time, ken and clive happened upon each other in a forest. Chatting and joking, time passed by quickly and they realised that it was so late that they would have to camp out in the forest that night. While they were sleeping, clive the magician sneezed with such magical violence that thousands of white-hot sparks shot out of his nose. Ken and clive had left their precious fleas on some leaves for the night and, unfortunately, one of the sparks landed on a leaf and the whole lot set alight. As the fire started spreading, the two magicians continued sleeping, and their fleas began to look decidedly nervous. They were all terribly clever and strong, so each one of the fleas thought of their own strategy to escape the fire. However, as they were still inside the bags, and they each jumped in all different directions, this meant that the bags stayed exactly where they were. One of the fleas noticed how they were all leaping in different directions, with no coordination. He realised that they would never escape like that. He stopped jumping, and gathered a group of fleas who he convinced to jump all at once. As they couldn't agree where to jump to, the flea suggested that they all jump first forward and then backward. The group started jumping together, and the rest of the fleas in the sack didn't take long to understand that jumping together would make it easier to escape the fire. So, soon all the fleas were jumping forwards, backwards, forwards, backwards… the fleas in the other bag saw this and imitated it. The two glass bags were now rolling backwards and forwards, towards each other, and with one last effort they collided and both bags shattered into a thousand pieces, setting the fleas free. By the time the fire had woken the magicians, it was already too late. Although they managed to put out the fire, their precious fleas had jumped far off into the night. And nothing more was ever heard of those truly exceptional fleas, although some people say that to this day they still work together to help each other survive the dangers of the wild.

['There were once - a long, long, very long time ago; so long ago that not even day and night existed, and upon the earth there lived only strange and magic creatures - two little elves who dreamed of jumping so high that they could manage to capture the clouds. One day, the great sky fairy saw them jumping again and again, in what seemed to be some useless but amusing game. They were trying to capture a few light clouds that were passing by at great speed. Their game so amused the sky fairy that she decided to grant each of the elves a wish. -"What would you most like in life? only one thing though, I can\'t give you more," She asked of the elf who seemed the most restless. The elf, excited at talking to one of the great fairies, and anxious to receive his wish, answered instantly. -"To jump! I want to be able to jump right over the mountains! above the clouds and the wind, and beyond the sun!" -"Are you sure?" Said the fairy "You don\'t want anything else?"The little elf, impatient, spoke of the years he had spent dreaming of having such an ability, and he assured the fairy that nothing could make him happier. The fairy, convinced, blew onto the elf and the elf instantly jumped so high that within moments he had soared through the clouds. Then he continued on towards the sun and, finally, they lost sight of him as he made his way to the stars. Then the fairy turned to the other elf. -"And you? what is it that you most want?"The second elf, who was a bit quieter than the first elf, went into deep thought. He scratched his chin, pulled at his ears, looked up at the sky, looked at the ground, looked again at the sky, rubbed his eyes, put a hand on his ear, looked again at the ground, put on a sad face, and finally answered:   -"I want to be able to catch anything, above all so I can break my friend\'s fall. otherwise he\'ll die when he comes plummeting back to earth."At that moment they began hearing a noise, like a far off little cry, and it was coming closer and closer, becoming louder and louder. Then they could clearly make out the horrified face of the first elf, who was fully expecting to soon experience the biggest crash-landing in history. But then the fairy blew on the second elf, and this elf managed to catch his friend and save his life. With his heart almost beating out of his chest, and his eyes filled with tears, the first elf regretted having been so impulsive, and he warmly embraced his good friend who - having thought a while before choosing his wish - had spent it on the first elf. Grateful for his generosity, the first jumping elf offered to swap the wishes, leaving himself with the useless one of catching elves, and giving his friend the ability to jump above the clouds. However, the second elf, who knew how much his friend had wanted his wish, decided they could share it by taking turns. And so, one would jump while the other caught, and then they would swap; and both would be equally happy. The fairy, moved by the elves\' friendship and companionship, presented each one with the most beautiful objects decorating the sky: the sun and the moon. From then on, the elf that was given the sun has jumped happily up every morning, his gift giving light to the world. And after a whole day he falls back to earth, caught by his friend. And then the friend himself leaps up, and the night sky is filled with moonlight. ', 'You should think about things before acting impulsively, in order to avoid unforeseen and painful consequences.

For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip-toes he flapped his wings and crowed lustily. But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a fox not far off in the wood.

He was so keen to remark on it to zero-zero that he ran towards the door. -"You may not leave," Said the robot, blocking his way, -"You must complete the process, you must spend the points on your card."Pancho was pensive. He had no desire to hit that poor little man any further, even though it was true that the little guy had really whacked him one…   -"It\'s fine. I forgive him," He said, finally. -"No," Repeated the robot, "You must use the points on your card. this is a process of perfect justice."What a pain! How could it be impossible to forgive someone? Pancho began to feel annoyed at this rather snooty robot, so he took his card, tore it in two, and said, -"Look! now there are no points left."The robot appeared to break down. It started emitting whistling noises, lots of lights all over its body lit up, and it lost control of its movements. Just when it appeared that it was going to explode, the robot returned to normal, and quietly said:   -"It is correct. now you may leave. thank you for using the system of perfect justice."The door opened, but before he could greet the shocked zero-zero, pancho had to remove the little man from himself, who was embracing him and thanking him as though pancho had saved his life. On leaving the sphere, pancho began to understand. All around he could see perfect justice system users lain on camp beds and looking tired and exhausted. Zero-zero explained that the main problem with the perfect justice system was that it was almost impossible to give out the exactly correct amount of harm, and the judgments and exchanges of blows would end up going on for days and days. So scared was everyone of ending up in the judgment process that many people lived isolated lives, inside small glass spheres, just like the little man pancho had fallen on. A few days later, pancho returned home, but his name was never forgotten on that planet. Previously, no one had forgiven anyone anything, but thanks to him they had discovered that forgiveness is a necessary part of justice. ', 'Forgiveness is a fundamental part of justice. ', 8]
["Once upon a time there was a river. This river was rather unfriendly and lonesome. The river could not remember how long ago he had decided that he no longer wanted to put up with anything or anyone. He lived alone, refusing to share his water with any fish, plant or animal. And so his life went on, sadly and filled with loneliness, for many centuries. One day, a little girl with a goldfish bowl came to the bank of this river. In the bowl lived scamp, her favourite little fish. The girl was about to move to another country, and she wouldn't be able to take scamp with her. So she had decided to give scamp his freedom. When scamp fell into the river, he immediately felt the river's loneliness. Scamp tried talking to the river, but the river told scamp to go away. Now, scamp was a very happy little fish, and he wasn't going to give up so easily. He asked and asked, swam and swam, and finally he started jumping in and out of the water. The river, feeling all the jumping and splashing, started to laugh. It tickled! After a while, this put the river in such a good mood that he started talking to scamp. Almost without knowing it, by the end of that day, scamp and the river had become very good friends. The river spent that night thinking about how much fun it was to have friends, and how much he had missed by not having them. He asked himself why he had never had them, but he couldn't remember. The next morning, scamp woke the river with a few playful splashes… and that was when the river remembered why he had decided to be such an unfriendly river: he remembered that he was very ticklish, and that he wouldn't have been able to stand it! Now he remembered perfectly how he had told everyone to scoot, that he wasn't going to put up with all that tickling. But, remembering how sad and lonely he had felt for so many years, the river realised that although it may sometimes be a bit inconvenient or uncomfortable, it was always better to have friends and to try to be happy. ", "It's always better to have friends and be happy - even though it may bring discomfort - than isolate yourself from people in order to avoid problems. ", 8]

["Once upon a time, there was a lovely vegetable patch, on which grew a very leafy tree. Both the patch and the tree gave the place a wonderful appearance, and were the pride and joy of the garden's owner. What no one knew was that the vegetables in the patch and the tree couldn't stand each other. The vegetables hated the tree's shadow, because it left them only just enough light to survive. The tree, on the other hand, resented the vegetables because they drank nearly all the water before it could get to him, leaving him with just enough to survive. The situation became so extreme that the vegetables got totally fed up and decided to use up all the water in the ground so that the tree would dry up. The tree answered back by refusing to shade the vegetables from the hot midday sun, so they too began to dry up. Before long, the vegetables were really scrawny, and the tree's branches were drying up. None of them suspected that the gardener, on seeing his vegetable patch deteriorating, would stop watering it. When he did that, both the tree and the vegetables really learned what thirst was. There seemed to be no solution, but one of the vegetables, a small courgette, understood what was going on, and decided to resolve it. Despite the little water available, and the unforgiving heat, the little courgette did all he could to grow, grow, grow… he managed to grow so big that the gardener started watering the patch again. Now the gardener wanted to enter that beautiful big courgette in some gardening contest. And so it was that the vegetables and the tree realised that it was better to help each other than to fight. They should really learn how to live in harmony with those around them, doing the best they could. So they decided to work together, using both the shade and the water in the best combination to grow good vegetables. Seeing how well they were doing, the gardener now gave the best of care to his vegetable patch, watering and fertilising it better than any other patch for miles around.

They tossed a coin on a sunday morning after church. Albrecht durer, one of the brother won the toss and went off to nuremberg. Albert, the other brother went to work at the mines and for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht\'s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than most of his professors. By the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works. When the young artist returned to his village, the durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate albrecht\'s triumphant homecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, albrecht rose from his honoured position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled albrecht to fulfil his ambition. His closing words were, "And now, albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. now you can go to nuremberg to pursue your dream and I will take care of you."All heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed. Finally, albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, "No, brother. I cannot go to nuremberg. it is too late for me. look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! the bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately, I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. my brother, for me, it is too late."More than 450 years have passed. By now, albrecht durer\'s hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolours, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one of albrecht durer\'s works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office. One day, to pay homage to albert for all that he had sacrificed, albrecht durer painstakingly drew his brother\'s abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply "Hands," But the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love "The praying hands." ', 'The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Remember the sacrifice others may have made for your success in life. Always, respect them and care for them as what they could have done for themselves, they did that for your happiness. ', 8]

He walked about restlessly, tearing up the ground with his toes, and beating his arms savagely against his sides. The moment he caught sight of me he opened his pointed mouth as if to swallow me, and then he let out a piercing roar that frightened me almost to death. "Can you guess who it was that our young mouse was trying to describe to his mother? it was nobody but the barnyard cock and the first one the little mouse had ever seen."If it had not been for that terrible monster," The mouse went on, "I should have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature, who looked so good and gentle. He had thick, velvety fur, a meek face, and a look that was very modest, though his eyes were bright and shining. As he looked at me he waved his fine long tail and smiled. "I am sure he was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out a screaming yell, and I ran for my life.""My son," Said the mother mouse, "That gentle creature you saw was none other than the cat. under his kindly appearance, he bears a grudge against every one of us. the other was nothing but a bird who wouldn\'t harm you in the least. as for the cat, he eats us. so be thankful, my child, that you escaped with your life, and, as long as you live, never judge people by their looks."

He was pulling a tough weed when he looked up and said, "What in the world!?", because he had seen his neighbor fox\'s, yard. It was all overgrown with weeds and vines. The worst part was it was growing over the fence into dog\'s yard. "That annoying fox," Sighed dog. "He\'s so lazy he won\'t even take care of his own yard. I\'ve gotta do something."

The fox approached the lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the ass, if he would pledge his word that his own life should be spared. On his assuring him that he would not injure him, the fox led the ass to a deep pit, and contrived that he should fall into it.

['"The best man in the whole tribe is manute the brave", everyone would say. You could see for yourself, at any time of the day, just how brave he was. He would jump to the ground from amazing heights, he would fight poisonous snakes, he would catch scorpions with his bare hands, and could cut the palm of his own hand with a knife - without even a flinch. They said the exact opposite about pontoma. No one had seen him catch even a monkey. One day, they happened upon each other in the forest, and manute was showing pontoma a coral snake he had just caught, when there began a downpour, the likes of which no one had ever seen. They both ran to shelter themselves under some thick foliage, and there they stayed until the rain had stopped. However, when they were about to leave the shelter, they heard the roar of a tiger, at a distance of only a couple of meters. The foliage was very thick and dense, and the tiger wouldn\'t be able to get through it to attack them. However, the tiger was almost at the entrance hole. If it happened to come in and find the two tribesmen there, they certainly wouldn\'t get out alive. Manute was getting restless. He wanted to get out of that tight hole, and confront the tiger in open space, where he could fully use his great hunting skills. Pontoma was gesturing at him to keep still and be quiet, but manute, tired of being stuck with a coward, leapt out of the thicket, surprising the tiger. The tiger suffered a couple of deep wounds, but soon recovered, and hurt manute with two swipes of its paw, throwing him to the ground. The tiger took the initiative, and leapt upon manute, but manute\'s spear, in the hands of pontoma, interrupted the tiger\'s attack. The tiger turned away, wounded, but the spear moved as fast as a beam of light, and with incredible precision, hurting the animal again and again, until it fell to the ground, lifeless. Manute, shocked, and bleeding freely from his injuries, witnessed all this while lying flat on his back on the ground. Never before had he seen anyone take on a tiger, and use the spear with such calmness and strength, as he had seen pontoma do just now. Neither of them said a thing. Manute\'s grateful expression needed no words to be understood. Nor did they need words to know about pontoma\'s wounded hand, or the fact that they were leaving a tiger skin there in the forest. From that day on, people gradually remarked less on manute\'s braveness. They thought maybe he was less courageous than before. The strangest thing was that they now noticed that manute\'s old spear was among pontoma\'s things. But manute just smiled, and remembered the day he learned that true bravery lay not in seeking out danger, but in controlling one\'s fear when danger crosses your path. ', 'Bravery is a lot different to recklessness. Bravery is not searching out fear or danger, but being able to control fear when it most matters. ', 8]
['George the giant had lived for centuries in the cave of anger. The giants were peaceful, solitary beings up until the time when king terry the terrible accused them of ruining the harvest. King terry then ordered that the giants be hunted down. Only george survived this, and since then he had become the most ferocious creature there had ever been. He became invincible, and anyone who entered his cave came to a sticky end, no matter how brave or powerful they were. Many past kings, ashamed by the behaviour of terry the terrible, had tried to make peace with george, but it was all in vain. His anger and fury meant that he would do away with any human being he ever clapped eyes on, without listening to what they said. Even though the kings now left him alone, george\'s hatred for humans remained as strong as ever. For there was a fabulous treasure inside george\'s cave, and many adventurers and warriors came there from all corners of the world to try to take it. Even so, one day the young princess was bitten by a snake from the swamps. The only antidote was a secret potion known only to giants. So the king had no choice but to beg for george\'s help. He sent his best soldiers and his bravest knights, promising them that if one of them was successful, they could marry the princess. However, neither their magic shields, their most powerful weapons, nor their most gleaming armour could do anything in the face of george\'s fury. Finally, the king asked for help throughout the kingdom, still promising the princess\'s hand, and offering the protection of the best wizards. Many tried, armed in all sorts of different ways, and protected by the best magic, including even an invisibility spell. But every last one of them failed. Then, one day, a young musician turned up at george\'s cave, armed only with a harp. He made a plea to the wizards. "I want to change into a beautiful flower, and have the voice of an angel". And so there appeared, at the cave entrance, an incredibly beautiful flower, which was singing a lovely tune to the sound of a harp. George the giant was used to hearing only the ugly clanking of weapons, shields, and armour. On hearing something so different, and so wonderful, his anger started to subside. The flower kept singing, and george moved closer. He took the flower in is hand, so he would be able to hear it better. The song was the story of a young princess close to death, who could only be saved by a good-hearted giant. George was moved, and listened with great emotion. He became so calm and tranquil that the flower felt it was safe enough to stop singing. And in his normal speaking voice he told george all about the princess and how she needed george\'s help. He also told george that the king wanted to come to a fair and lasting peace agreement with him. George, tired of so much fighting, and seeing the truth of what the flower was telling him, left his cave and his anger behind, and went to heal the princess. The young musician not only overcame george\'s anger, he also won the princess\'s heart and the hearts of all in the kingdom. Eventually, he became the best king that land had ever had.

['There was once a rich and kindly old man who, reaching the end of his days, decided to leave his possessions to some honest and intelligent young man. Speaking of this decision, he told a good friend that he wanted to choose wisely. The friend advised him,"The next time you sell something, and are giving the customer their change, make sure you give them too much. the customer who returns the extra money to you, you will know that they are honest". The rich man thanked his friend for the advice, and thinking it a good idea, and easy to carry out, he decided to try it. What he did not know was this. One of those present during the conversation - a neighbour who pretended to be his friend, but was really very envious of the rich old man - hired the services of a wizard. He paid the wizard to cast a spell on the rich old man\'s coins. The spell would mean that anyone who saw coins touched by the old man, rather than seeing them as coins, would see them as that which the customer wanted most in the world. With this plan, the envious neighbour believed that no customer would return the old man\'s change, and, having no one to leave his money to, the old man would leave it all to the neighbour\'s young nephew. Indeed, everything went according to plan for the greedy neighbour, and not a single customer was able to return the enchanted coins. Some saw in these coins the biggest diamond or precious stone, others saw a work of art, some saw a relic, and some saw a miraculous healing potion. When the old man had almost given up trying to find an honest person, the greedy neighbour sent his nephew to the old man\'s business, taking great care to instruct the boy to return the old man\'s money. The nephew was determined to do so, but on receiving the enchanted coins he saw in them all the possessions and honours of his own uncle. Believing that what his uncle had told him was a trick, he left with his useless coins and his greed, to no end, since when his uncle learned of this betrayal, he made his nephew banish forever. The rich old man, sick and depressed, decided to call his servants before he died. He gave them some possessions so that they could live freely when he was no longer with them. Among these servants was a youth, who received some portion of this money by mistake. The youth, raised in the house of the wise and just old man, who he loved like a father, saw, in place of the money, a powerful medicine which would cure the old man, since this was truly what he most wanted in the world. On seeing this, the youth offered the money back to the old man, saying "Take this, sir, it\'s for you; it will make you feel better."And the return of that simple coin indeed acted like the most miraculous of cures. The old man leapt with joy at having finally found an honest person, and it filled him with joy to find that this honest person had always been in his very own house. And so, the young servant went on to manage, with great justice, generosity and honesty, all the old man\'s possessions and business concerns. And the old man went on to accompany and advise him like a son for many more years.

In the audience were all the toymakers in the world, and many others who weren\'t toymakers, but who had lately come to be regular attendees. There were also those who, of course, could never miss the conference; the distributors: santa claus and the three wise kings. Like every year, the discussions dealt with what kind of toys were the most educational or the most fun. Another common topic of conversation was what size of toys should be made. Yeah, that was something they often argued about, because the three wise kings and father christmas complained that every year the toys were getting bigger, and this was causing serious transportation problems.

Toby remembered that it had all happened because he had been highly disobedient, but he had never given a thought to reddit until now…toby now realised he was being very unfair to fran.

['According to legend, stickybeard was the most sweet-toothed pirate who ever existed. He spent years raiding and pillaging sweetshops, and, so they say, he buried the greatest hoard of treasure any child could imagine, in some forgotten place. So when tony and his friends found a strange old wooden chest, along with what seemed to be a treasure map for children, they were understandably excited. They readied themselves for the great stickybeard treasure hunt. Off they went, and, following clues from the map, they arrived at a dark cave next to a lake. There they found another, smaller, chest. In it they found a few sweets, a big sign containing just the letter d, and another map with further instructions for finding the treasure. This helped the children get over the initial disappointment of realising they hadn\'t yet found the great treasure of stickybeard. Tony and his friends took several days to decode the map, and had to consult quite a few books to manage it. It led them to a great big hollow tree, where, again, they found another chest containing some sweets, a new map, and a big letter o written on a piece of paper.

['Thomas crum was a boy made from blue and orange plasticine, and he lived in a school. Even though he had many good qualities, he had started to lack respect for others. When his aunt agatha, a big multi-coloured ball of plasticine, gave him a drum for his birthday, he was a nightmare. It didn\'t matter to him if everyone asked him to play the drum a little quieter, or to go and play somewhere else: thomas went all round the classroom beating his drum, and the fact that he was annoying others didn\'t affect him in the least. His classmates stopped wanting to play with him. They suffered so much from his noisy drum that even coco wiseman, a very intelligent figure made of lego, invented some special earplugs which allowed you to hear normal sounds, but blocked out the annoying ones. On seeing that the others were ignoring him, and not even being annoyed any more, thomas got very angry with coco wiseman. After a big fight, the inventor ended up falling to the floor all the way from the height of the table. On impact, the blocks he was made of broke up and separated. Even though it was an accident, everyone was angry with thomas. No one wanted anything more to do with him, although that didn\'t bother him a great deal.

He spent many days and nights working on him, and he finally finished the job just when he could hardly have gone on any longer, what with hardly getting any sleep because of the cuckoo clock. When coco was built and came back to life, everyone got a huge surprise, and they enthusiastically congratulated and thanked thomas for all his work. Thomas, in return, asked them to forgive him for his lack of consideration. And so, although coco wiseman was a bit angry at him, thomas managed to convince him to make a pair of earplugs for him too. Finally thomas could get some sleep, and never again was he as inconsiderate as he had been before.

['Marina was extremely afraid of the dark. When the lights went out, everything and every shadow appeared to her as the most terrible of monsters. Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark. One day her aunt valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened. "A great many times, marina," Answered her aunt, "I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn\'t stay in the dark for even a moment". Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark? "I\'ll tell you a secret, marina. it was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. they can\'t see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened". "It\'s true!" Said marina, intrigued, "Can you tell me that secret?" "Of course! the secret is to change your eyes. since blind children can\'t see, their hands are their eyes. all you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. let\'s make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that\'s making you scared. but do it using your hands as eyes… and tomorrow tell me how you\'re getting on with the fear".

She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this.

['Whenever there was a storm, the animals of the enchanted forest ran, frightened, to hide, fearful of the bolts of lightning and the terrifying thunder. However, one day the storm came on so quickly that almost no one had the time to reach their hideout and, just when they were most frightened, some of the animals saw a tiny little light appear from out of the trees, coming from a spot where a bolt of lightning had just hit. The little light was jumping and joyfully and excitedly crying out. All the animals watching ran over to see who this mad being could be, a being would could be happy in the middle of a storm. And so it was that they met the very first of the spark wizards, which were tiny little beings that shone intensely all over, as if they had somehow managed to swallow a star. Flint, as this spark wizard was known, turned out to be very nice and very charming, and when they asked him how he could be so joyful in the middle of such a ferocious storm, he replied with surprise:   -"But why wouldn\'t I be happy when I\'ve just escaped after two thousand years?"He went on to explain how, thousands of years ago, the dark wizard had captured all the spark wizards and imprisoned them inside some big black clouds where he forced them to work as his slaves. It was almost impossible to escape that prison, but now and again, some of those clouds would collide, and with that impact little tufts of cloud would break off, allowing a spark wizard to escape. Each time one escaped it would leap out with such eagerness that its trail of light would illuminate the whole sky, and produce what we know as a lightning bolt. Not long after such an escape, the dark wizard would realise what had happened and would grumble furiously about it and beat the clouds in frustration. His cries were filled with anger, and this is why rolls of thunder boom so strongly around the skies. Excited at flint\'s story, those animals were never again frightened at the storms and the thunder. Instead, when the sky began to cover with black clouds, all the animals would gather at the big rock, where they could get the best view of the storm. There they would applaud and cheer each time a little spark wizard managed to escape the clutches of the dark wizard. Even better, each time the dark wizard came out with one of his angry grumbles of protest, the animals would answer him with a chorus of boos and jeers.

['Once upon a time there was a painter who, on one of his journeys, got so lost that he ended up approaching a dragon\'s lair. As soon as the dragon clapped eyes on the painter he roared ferociously at him for disturbing him in his cave. -"No one who dares enter this place leaves alive!"The painter excused himself and tried to explain that he was lost. He assured the dragon that he would leave without bothering him any more, but the dragon was still determined to flatten him. -"Listen, dragon. you have no reason to kill me, I can even be of help to you." -"What nonsense you speak, dwarf ! how could you possibly help me? you, who are so weak and tiny! do you know how to do anything at all? I\'m a bit surprised you even know how to breathe! ha ha haaa!" -"Well, I\'m a great painter. I can see that your scales have faded a bit, and, certainly, with just a lick of paint I could help you to be much scarier and combine that with a much more modern look…"The dragon thought for a while, and soon decided to spare the painter\'s life on the condition that he would become his slave and paint and decorate him to his taste. The painter did as was requested, giving the dragon an incredible appearance. The dragon liked it so much that he often asked the painter to make some new changes and retouch his work. Over time, the dragon began to treat him better, almost like a friend. However, as much as the painter asked him, the dragon wasn\'t prepared to let him go free, and he took the painter everywhere with him. During one of these journeys the painter and the dragon arrived at a great mountain. They were making their way around it when they realised the mountain was moving… and it began to roar with such a noise that left the dragon half dead with fear. In reality, that mountain was a giant titan who felt so angry and offended at the dragon\'s presence that he assured the dragon he wouldn\'t rest until he had flattened him. The dragon, frightened by the titan\'s size, apologised and tried to explain that he had arrived there by mistake. But the titan was determined to destroy the dragon. -"But listen, great titan, I\'m a dragon and I can be very useful to you," Said the dragon. -"You? little dwarf dragon? help me? you know how to do anything of use? ha ha haaaa!" -"I\'m a dragon, and I shoot fire from my mouth. I could roast your food and heat your bed before bedtime…"The titan, just as the dragon had done, accepted the proposal, and made the dragon his slave, treating him as though he was a match or a lighter. One night, when the titan was asleep, the dragon looked sadly and shamefully at the painter. -"Now that it\'s happened to me, I\'ve realised what I did to you… forgive me, I shouldn\'t have abused my strength and my size." And breaking the painter\'s chains, the dragon added:   -"Run! escape! the titan is asleep and you are so small he can\'t even see you."The painter felt happy at having been set free, but seeing the dragon, for whom he had felt much affection, and who had understood the injustice of his actions, he stayed close by, trying to think of a plan to liberate the dragon. The next morning, when the titan awoke, he found the dragon lying at his side, dead, with his head cut off. The titan roared and roared and roared, furiously, thinking that this had been the work of his cousin, the most evil titan he knew of. The titan quickly moved off to find him so he could break his head into a thousand pieces. When the titan had gone, the painter woke the dragon who was still sleeping quietly in the same spot. On waking, the dragon found the other dragon with its head cut off, which turned out to be nothing but some rocks that the little artist had painted to look like a dead dragon. And, looking at himself, the dragon could see that he was hardly visible, as while he was sleeping the painter had made his scales look like a green meadow. Both fled as fast as they could, and the dragon, grateful for having been saved, promised his friend, the painter, that never again would he use his strength and size to abuse anyone. Instead, he would always use them to help those who most needed it. ', "No matter how big or strong someone is, there's always someone bigger who can do just as they do. ", 9]

['Why we got this life? Why do we suffer? One day, a mahatma went to a walk with his disciple. Mahatma liked to speak less and do his work peacefully where as disciple was very agile. While walking, they were passing by a pond and there they saw that a fisherman was laying a trap in pond to catch fishes. Seeing this, disciple went to fisherman and started teaching him - ahimsa paramo dharma. Fisherman ignored him and continued with his work but disciple decided that he had to take him out of path of violence. Soon, a fight ensued between disciple and fisherman. Seeing this mahatma took his disciple aside and said, "Our work is only to explain, not to punish.."Disciple replied, "But our king doesn\'t punish. then who will punish this violent man?"Mahatma replied, "Don\'t worry. there is power which is everywhere, he will receive his punishment. god sees everything, therefore it is wrong for you to get into fight."Disciple was satisfied listening to mahatma answer and left with him.

I stopped you because I knew what karma he was suffering and also I had to show you a glimpse of justice of god.I didn\'t help because I knew but if I didn\'t knew and still didn\'t help the suffering then it would be my sin."Disciple was now beginning to understand mahatma\'s words in true sense.

['Long-era ago, in india lived a boy named eklavya, son of tribal chief in the forest of kingdom hastinapur. Eklavya was brave and handsome boy who was loved by all. His father saw that something was troubling him. Many times he saw his son lost in deep thought and other boys used to play and hunt for pleasure. One day father asked his son, "Why are you so unhappy? why don\'t you play with your friends?""I want to be a archer. I want to be a disciple of the great guru dronacharya, the greatest tutor of archery in hastinapur. his gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors.", he replied. "I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. so please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of dronacharya.", he addedhis father knew it not going to be easy for him but he didnot want to refuse the only wish of his son. So, father gave his blessings. Eklavya set on his way to reach part of forest where drona taught the princes of hastinapur. When boy reached drona\'s gurukul and saw it was consisted of several huts surrounded by treesand an archery yard. There he saw a man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy. Though eklavya had never seen drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? He asked. "Dronacharya, I am eklavya, son of the tribal chief in the western part of the forests of hastinapura." Eklavya replied. "Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of archery."Drona sighed. "Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a shudra, the lowest social community according to the vedic caste system. I am a brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a shudra boy" He said. The innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by drona\'s refusal to teach him. "It\'s not fair!" He thought miserably. "God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind." He left the place with a broken heart but it could not shatter his ambition to learn archery. He was still as determined to learn archery. "I may be a shudra but does it make any difference?" Thought he. "I am as strong and zealous as drona\'s princes and disciples. if I practice the art everyday, I can surely become an archer."Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his guru. Day after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed eklavya the mere tribal hunter into eklavya the extraordinary archer. One day while eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first the boy ignored the dog, but continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking. Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, eklavya fired several arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog\'s mouth without injuring it. As a result it roamed the forests with its mouth opened. As fate would have it, that day, drona was instructing prince about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the "Stuffed" Dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too. " Such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer." He exclaimed. He told the pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. Drona said,"Your aim is truly remarkable! from whom did you learn archery?" Eklavya was thrilled to hear drona\'s praises. How surprised he will be if he told drona that he, in fact was his guru! "From you my master. you are my guru," Eklavya replied humbly. "Your guru? how can I be your guru? I have never seen you before!" Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his gurukul several months ago. " Now I remember," Said he. "Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my gurukul some months back?""Yes, dronacharya", replied the boy. "After I left your gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshiped it every day. I practiced before your image. you refused to teach me, but your statue did not. thanks to it, I have become a good archer."Hearing this, arjuna became angry. "But you promised me that you\'d make me the best archer in the world!" He accused drona. "Now how can that be? now a common hunter has become better than me!" The other princes remembered their master frequently praising arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. What will their teacher do now? Unable to answer arjuna\'s question, drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to prince arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish eklavya. "Where is your guru dakhsina? you have to give me a gift for your training," The sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make eklavya suffer for his disobedience. Eklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all. "Dronacharya, I\'ll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina "He said. "I might ask something you don\'t like to give me. what if you refuse the dhakshina I want?" Drona asked cunningly. Eklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru\'s dakshina was refused. "No! how can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. I\'ll never refuse anything you ask, dronacharya," Promised the unsuspecting boy. Drona did not wait anymore. "Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina" He declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy? For a moment eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. "Ok gurudev, as you wish." Said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb! The princes gasped at eklavya\'s act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain, and held out his severed thumb to dronacharya. "Here is my guru dakshina, drona", ekalavya said. "I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I\'m a mere shudra hunter."The sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. "Eklavya, even with out your thumb, you\'ll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru," Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to arjuna was not broken. The gods blessed eklavya from above. But despite his handicap, eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness. And true to drona\'s blessing, eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of mahabharatha.

["A long time ago, just after he created the world, god decided to take a day off. As all the animals were newly made and didn't know what they should do, god couldn't leave them on their own so he went in search of an angel to look after them. Even though he was a bit useless, perico the little angel so wanted to be with the animals and pleaded so much to be allowed to take care of them that god gave him the job. 'make sure they go to sleep before dark and are awake before dawn. We can't leave the earth empty! ' was the only advice god gave him. Filled with excitement, perico went down to earth and spent the day playing with the animals. He was so happy that it was nearly night time when he remembered that he needed to send the animals to bed. 'come on everyone, quickly! Off to sleep. ''where do we leave all of our parts? ' asked the animals. They hadn't had them for long and weren't used to sleeping with their ears, beaks, claws, noses and feet, which they took off to go to bed. 'I'm not too sure: just leave them there in a pile. Come on quick, it's getting late', perico replied impatiently. Just before the last ray of sun disappeared, all the animals were in bed. 'wow, that was close. I got away with it' thought the little angel. And then, very tired, he went to bed. He woke up just before dawn and hurried to wake the animals. 'come on! Get up! You need to put all your parts on and be awake before daybreak'. All the sleepy animals headed for the pile of ears, teeth and feet to get dressed. But the pile was such a mess and they were in such a rush that they couldn't work out what belonged to each animal, so they all took what they could and got dressed quickly. Once again, they made it just in time, and a very relieved perico, the little angel, went for breakfast. Before he had finished his breakfast, a rabbit came up in tears. It complained that it had been bitten 3 times already. 'why don't you just run off before they attack you? ' said the angel, 'don't rabbits have big ears so they can listen out for their enemies before they get close? ''do you think these are big? ' said the little rabbit, pointing to his tiny frog ears. 'why are you wearing ears that aren't yours? ''because this morning nobody could find anything in that huge pile' interrupted an angry crocodile. 'I had to put these beaver teeth in and now everyone is laughing at me because I can't close my mouth'. 'stop moaning' said the grumpy lion, 'my penguin feet are even funnier'. More and more animals arrived with loads of problems: a monkey with a trunk, a hedgehog with feathers, a bird with a tortoise's shell. The angel realised that doing things in a rush and leaving everything in a pile had not been such a good idea, so he called all the animals together to propose a solution. 'from now on, we'll stop playing half an hour earlier so that each animal can go to a different place where they will have time to put their parts away. Rather than putting all the bits together, we are going to separate them into small groups, noses with noses, ears with ears, claws with claws, and so on. That afternoon, half an hour before sunset, the animals went off and each found a place that they liked. The fish went to the sea, the birds to the trees, jungle animals to the jungle, penguins to the south pole … they left their parts in well-organised small piles and the following morning it didn't take long to find them and get ready.

'even though he was a bit hopeless, angel perico was also very honest and found the courage to tell god what had happened and the mistake he had made. In the end, however, god loved his little angel's solution and the fact that each animal had its own special place. In fact, he liked the new arrangement so much that he decided to give perico and the other angels a part from his favourite animal as a present.

['When alicia was very small she found the most beautiful flower in the forest but instead of plucking it, she stroked it and sang to it for a while. It was then that the magical animals of the forest chose her to be their protector, although she didn\'t know that yet. From then on, they took care of alicia and taught her many things without her even noticing. But there was something that they couldn\'t teach her: alicia rarely finished things properly. And that was something very important for a protector. "She has to travel into the paper and learn there.""But that\'s very dangerous""There\'s no other way. she\'s getting older."So, while she slept, they blew gently on her fingers. Next morning, alicia drew a lovely picture of her house and family. When she finished, she let the pencil fall onto the paper. However, instead of landing on it, the pencil sunk into the page as if it had been thrown into a pool. When it reappeared, it was a part of the drawing. The same thing happened with the table, and with everything else that touched the paper. The page grew and grew as it flew around the house sucking up the furniture and paintings. Alicia tried to stop it but just by touching it she too became part of the drawing. When she got over her fright and saw herself inside the world of drawings, she decided to investigate. As she took her first step, however, she felt a strong pain in her leg and fell over. "What a fall, alicia," Said nasco, the dog by her side, or something like a dog, because it had 5 legs and was covered in white spots that hadn\'t been coloured in. "Didn\'t you realise that you\'re missing a foot?"It was true. While rushing to finish, alicia had forgotten to draw one of her feet. Now she had to hop. "Grrrrrnnnn, adnthv,… nanana" She tried to respond. However, she had also drawn herself such a twisted mouth that nobody could understand what she was saying. Alicia went over the rest of the drawing of her body. She was missing an elbow, several fingers and his nose, she also had a horrible hairstyle … but she didn\'t think it was that bad. She was more worried about her parents. She wasn\'t sure she\'d put eyes and mouths on them and she ran around the house looking for them. But she had drawn them outside, and when she wanted to go out she realised that she hadn\'t drawn the door of the house either! She was still thinking how to get out when, through the uncoloured holes in the wall, she saw strange beings starting to surround the house. After a brief silence, they threw themselves at the house, trying to enter, and eventually one of them took advantage of a big uncoloured hole to get in. "I should have coloured the walls better," Alicia thought as she recognized the attacker. It was a black monster full of blotches that she drew one day when she was in a bad mood. More monsters followed him through the same hole and alicia only had time to flee, hopping after nasco.. "Follow me," Said the dog, "Piko can help us."Alicia looked at him, surprised. Piko was only a little songbird. "You\'re thinking it\'s small, aren\'t you? I think you\'ve forgotten how you drew it…"When they entered the living room they saw a gigantic bird trapped in a tiny cage. Alicia quickly freed it, and piko lifted the girl and the dog into the air just before the monsters fell on them. "Through the window, piko!" Ordered the dog. "We will be safer outside the house". Piko escaped through the window and flew around looking for the rest of the family. Then alicia spotted her pencil close to home and pointed out to the bird where to set her down. Once on the ground, the girl picked up the pencil and ran towards the house. She got there just in time to colour in the spots she missed in the wall and left the monsters trapped inside. "Good!" Shouted nasco and piko. Then alicia, looking at how much she had rushed to finish her drawing, took the pencil and started to finish it off, correcting her errors. But her elbowless arm failed her and the pencil fell to the ground, drawing a little black dot. "Oh no!" Said nasco. "What\'s wrong with the dot?" Asked piko"Well… it\'s not a dot… it\'s a black hole!"And the moment the black hole started to grow and grow, absorbing everything with such force that nothing could escape its darkness. Alicia appeared back at her table, together with her drawing and pencil. She thought that it had all been a dream, but on looking closer she saw that the wall of the house was now completely coloured in… and she breathed a sigh of relief. "That was very dangerous", said the magical creatures from their hiding place. "Yes, but she has learnt that you can\'t leave things half done, even if they don\'t seem important. and this has turned her into a great protector."And it was true, because ever since then alicia finished things as carefully as she had started them, especially all her drawings. All? Well, not all of them, because alicia always made sure to never draw feet on her monsters, just in case. ', 'Paying attention to detail and taking your time is the way to do a job well done.

["On noah's ark things were getting a bit boring. Noah and his animals had spent so many days secluded there that they started organising games and activities to amuse themselves. But, with all that pent up energy, the games got rather rowdy, and a woodpecker ended up drilling a hole in the bottom of the ark. As water began entering the boat, the hole got bigger. So, more water came in, and things got a bit worrying. One by one, different animals tried to fix the hole. They even got competitive about it because everyone wanted to be the animal that had saved the ark. The beaver built a dam over the hole, but not even that worked. Everyone was scared, worried that the boat would sink. That was, until the bee started talking. The bee explained to everyone how it was that bees always worked together, as a team, each one doing the job they were best at. On hearing this, all the animals set about working together, each one playing their part by contributing their own special talent. The birds grabbed onto parts of the ark with their beaks, and flapped their wings furiously, lifting the boat up a little. The elephants sucked up the water in their trunks and shot it back into the sea. The fastest animals ran here and there, collecting materials. Those used to making nests took this material and stuffed it quickly into the hole. And so, working together, the animals managed to reduce the amount of water coming into the ark, but they still hadn't stopped it completely. Desperate, they kept asking each other if there were any other animals that could help. They searched and searched, but there were no other animals left in the ark. Then, suddenly, a little fish swam in through the hole. The animals realised that they still had not asked for help from all the sea creatures. They asked the little fish to go and summon help to save their boat. He swam off and soon fish after fish arrived at the ark. Even a big whale came, and the whale pressed its great belly against the hole in the ship. This stopped any more water entering, and it gave the animals on the ark time to close up the hole.

['Adalina was no ordinary fairy. No one knew why, but she had no wings. And, what\'s more, she was a princess, daughter of the great fairy queen. As she was so tiny, like a flower, life was just a series of problems for her. Not only couldn\'t she fly, but she hardly had any magical powers, since fairy magic comes from their delicate crystal wings. So, from an early age, adalina had depended on the help of others for many things. She grew up thanking people, smiling and being friendly, so naturally all the creatures in the forest were delighted to help her. But when she reached the age to become queen, many fairies doubted she could be a good queen with such a disability. They argued and protested so much that adalina had to agree to take a test in which she would have to demonstrate to everyone the wonders she could work. The little fairy became extremely sad. What could she do? She was hardly magic at all, and couldn\'t even travel far with those little legs of hers. But while adalina sat on a stone next to the river, trying to think of something that would surprise the other fairies, the news of the test was spreading among the friendly forest animals. Before long, hundreds of creatures were by her side, ready to help her however she needed. -"Thank you so much, little friends. I feel much better with you by my side," She said with the sweetest of smiles, -"But I don\'t know whether you\'ll be able to help me." -"Of course we will!" Answered the squirrel, -"Tell us, what will you do to surprise those foolish fairies?" -"Wow…. if only I could, I would love to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the earth, and keep it in a dewdrop, so that when it was needed it could be used as a lantern for all who live in the forest. or… I\'d also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that the nocturnal creatures could see its beauty… but I don\'t have any magic or any wings to keep it in…" -"Well, you must have your magic kept somewhere else then! look!" An old tortoise shouted excitedly, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it. It was true. When adalina had been telling her friends of her deepest wishes, a wave of magic had washed over them, and there they all were, flying through the air, making a magic rainbow, and capturing not just one but hundreds of rays of sunshine within fine drops of water that filled the sky with tiny brilliant lamps.

["There was once a boy whose parents were the custodians of an impressive old castle. The place was full of old paintings, arms and armour. One day, the boy noticed something strange about one of the main paintings. Normally, it showed one of the old kings, with sceptre in hand, standing next to his son and some members of the court. But the king had disappeared from the painting. The boy was very worried by this, and he thought he must have made some mistake; but a while later he walked past the painting once more, and noticed that the sceptre had been left there by the king, and was leaning over. The boy was intrigued. Even more so when, soon after, he saw that the angle of the sceptre had increased. At that rate, in a few hours it would end up hitting the prince on the head. So the boy started looking throughout the castle for the missing king. Finally, he found him in one of the castle bathrooms, quietly enjoying a wonderful bubble bath in the biggest bathtub in the whole building. The boy was speechless.

He had gotten so dirty that he couldn't stand it a second more, and had had to run off to get a bath. When the boy had recovered from the surprise, he respectfully explained to the king what was about to happen with the sceptre and the prince.

['There was once a very unfair prince, although he seemed like the perfect prince: handsome, brave, and intelligent. Prince lapio gave the impression that no one had ever explained to him the nature of justice. If two people came to him over some dispute, expecting him to resolve the matter, he would decide in favour of whichever one seemed most charming, or most handsome, or whoever had the best-looking sword. Tired of all this, lapio\'s father, the king, decided to get a wise man to teach his son about justice. "My wise friend, please take him away," Said the king, "And don\'t bring him back until he\'s ready to be a just and fair king."The wise man left by boat, with the prince, but they suffered a shipwreck and ended up together, as the only survivors, on a desert island. There they had no food or water. For the first few days, prince lapio, a great hunter, managed to catch some fish. When the old wise man asked him to share the fish with him, the young prince refused. However, some days later, the prince\'s fishing became less successful, while the old man was managing to catch birds almost every day. Just as the prince had done, the wise man refused to share his catch. Lapio got thinner and thinner, until he finally burst into tears and begged the wise man to share some of his food to save him from starving to death. "I will only share them with you", said the wise man, "If you show me you\'ve learnt your lesson." The prince, having learned what the wise man was trying to teach him, said, "Justice consists of sharing what we have, equally." The wise man congratulated him, and gave him some food. That same afternoon a ship rescued them from the island. On their return journey they stopped a while by a mountain, where a man recognised the prince, and told him: "I am max, chief of the maximum tribe. please help us, we are having trouble with the neighbouring tribe: the minimums. we both share meat and vegetables, and we argue about how to share them out." "Very easily solved," Answered the prince, "Count how many of you there are altogether, and share the food in equal proportions." And so, he had already made good use of what the wise man had taught him. But after saying this, came the sound of thousands of cries from the mountainside. A hoard or angry men came running over, and led by the chief, who had asked the question, they leapt on prince lapio, and took him prisoner. Lapio couldn\'t understand this at all. They threw him in a prison cell, and told him, "You tried to kill our people. if you don\'t solve this problem by daybreak tomorrow, you will stay in prison forever." They had done this to the prince because the minimums were small and numerous, whereas the maximums were enormous, but there were very few of them. So the solution suggested by the prince would have starved the maximums to death. The prince understood the situation, and spent all that night thinking. The next morning, when they asked him for a solution, he said: "Don\'t share the food equally. instead, share it out according to how much each person eats. give people food according to their size." The maximums liked this answer so much that they released the prince, held a great party, garlanded him with gold and jewels, and bid him and the wise man a safe journey. As they were walking along, the prince commented, "I\'ve learned something new. it is not fair to give the same to all. the fair thing is to share, but you must take people\'s differing needs into account." The wise man smiled with satisfaction. Already close to the palace, they stopped in a small village. A man of very poor appearance received them and made sure they were well attended. Meanwhile, another man, of similar poor appearance, threw himself to the ground in front of them, begging. A third, who seemed to be a rich man, sent two of his servants to tend to the prince and the wise man, and provided them with what they needed. The prince so enjoyed his time there that, on his departure, he presented the villagers with all the gold which the maximums had given him. Hearing this, the poor man, the beggar, and the rich man, all ran up to the prince, each one asking for his share. " How will you share it out?" Asked the wise man, "The three are very different, and it looks like the one who gives away more gold is the rich man…"The prince hesitated. The wise man was right. The rich man had to pay his servants, he was the one who had spent most gold, and he had looked after them well. However, the prince was starting to develop a sense of justice, and something told him that his first conclusion on this matter was not sufficient. Finally, the prince took his gold and made three piles: one very big, another medium sized, and the last one small. In that order he gave them to the poor man, the rich man, and the beggar. Saying his goodbyes, the prince set off with the wise man, heading back to the palace. They walked in silence, and when they reached the palace gate, the wise man asked: "Tell me something, young prince. what does justice mean to you?" "I think justice lies in sharing, taking into account necessities, but also the merits of the individual." "Is that why you gave the smallest pile to the troublemaking beggar?" Asked the wise man, contentedly. "Yes, that\'s why. I gave the big pile to the poor man who looked after us so well. in him I saw both necessity and merit, since, he helped us all he could, despite being poor. the medium pile was for the rich man. even though he attended to us wonderfully, he really did not have much need for more gold. the small pile I gave to the bothersome beggar because he did nothing worthy of reward. however, given his great need, it was also right to give hive something to live on." Explained the prince. "I think you\'ll be a fine king, prince lapio", concluded the wise man, embracing the prince. And he was right. From then on, the prince became known throughout the kingdom for his fairness and wisdom. Some years later, his ascent to the throne was celebrated by all. And so it was, that king lapio became remembered as the best leader the kingdom had ever had. ', 'Three brief adventures to illustrate the nature of justice. ', 10]

The old door was removed and thrown outside, next to the rubbish. There lay the beautiful living-room door, regretting what it had done. For not being able to put up with things for just a little longer, it now found itself discarded, waiting to be turned into sawdust. Meanwhile, his friend, the ordinary bathroom door, remained in its place, and the children were treating it with greater care…fortunately, the living-room door did not end up as sawdust. Instead, a very poor man found him amongst the rubbish, and although the door was broken, the man knew that this door was the best he would be able to find for his poor house. The door, in turn, was happy to have the chance to be a proper door again, and to graciously accept the discomforts of a job as hard as being a door.

["Pinty tailor was a little boy who enjoyed going to school and doing all sorts of things, except for art and writing. Using brushes and pencils did not come easy to pinty, so his works of art did not end happily, and he would just give up in disgust. But one day pinty found a pencil of such lovely colours that he could not resist, and he tried drawing a circle. As ever, it did not go well, and he was about to throw the pencil away when his drawing began to speak to him. 'psst! You aren't going to leave me like this, are you? Come on, the least you can do is draw me a pair of eyes! ' said the drawing. Pinty was understandably shocked, but he managed to draw two little spots inside the circle. 'much better, now I can see myself,' said the circle, looking around at itself… 'arghh! But what have you done to me?! ''I don't draw very well,' said pinty, trying to make excuses. 'ok, no problem,' the drawing interrupted him, 'I'm sure that if you try again you'll do better. Go on, rub me out! ' so pinty erased the circle and drew another one. Like the first one, it was not very round. 'hey! You forgot the eyes again! ''oh, yeah. ''hmmm, I think I'm going to have to teach you how to draw until you can do me well,' said the circle with its quick, squeaky little voice. To pinty, who remained almost paralysed with shock, this did not seem like a bad idea, and he immediately found himself drawing and erasing circles. The circle would not stop saying 'rub this out, but carefully; it hurts,' or 'draw me some hair, quickly, I look like a lollipop! ' and other funny remarks. After spending nearly the whole afternoon together, pinty could already draw the little figure much better than most of his classmates could have. He was enjoying it so much that he did not want to stop drawing with this crazy new teacher of his. Before going to bed that night, pinty gave his new instructor a hearty thank you for having taught him how to draw so well. 'but I didn't do anything, silly! ' answered the little drawing, in its usual quick manner. 'don't you see that you've been practicing a lot, and enjoying it all the while? I bet that's the first time you've done that! 'pinty stopped to think. The truth was that previously, he had drawn so badly because he had never practiced more than ten minutes at a time, and he had always done it angrily and grudgingly. Without doubt, what the little drawing had said was correct. 'ok, you're right, but thank you anyway,' said pinty, and before he went to bed he carefully placed the pencil in his school bag. The next morning pinty jumped out of bed and went running to find his pencil, but it was not there. He searched everywhere, but there was no sign of it. And the sheet of paper on which he had drawn the little figure, although still full of rubbing out marks, was completely blank. Pinty began to worry, and he did not know if he had really spent the previous afternoon talking with the little man or whether he had dreamt the whole thing. So, to try to settle the matter, he took a pencil and some paper and tried to draw a little man. It turned out not bad at all, except for a couple of jagged lines. He imagined his bossy little teacher telling him to round out those edges, and that it looked like he was trying to give him spots. Pinty gladly rubbed out those bits and redrew them. He realised that the crazy little teacher had been right: it made no difference whether you had the magic pencil or not; to manage to do things, you only needed to keep trying and to enjoy doing so. From that day on, whenever pinty tried to draw or paint, or do anything else, he always had fun imagining the result of his work protesting to him and saying 'come on, my friend, do me a bit better than that! I can't go to the party looking like this! ' ", 'You can do everything better when you practice with effort and joy. ', 10]
["A king who had no children announced a competition to decide who would be made a prince and heir to the throne. The boy who passed all the tests, although excellent, was impatient, and that worried the king.

The king left the boy with the dog, saying that if, upon his return, the boy and the treasures were still there, waiting for him, then the boy would receive the kingdom.

['Brenda bongos was a happy, artistic girl, a girl with one big ambition - to play the drums in a band. But one big obstacle lay in her way. To be good enough to play in a band brenda had to practice a lot, but she lived next-door to a lot of old people - many of them sick - in a care home. She knew that the sound of beating drums and crashing cymbals would really get on their nerves. Brenda was a very good, respectful, girl. She always tried to find a way of practicing her drums without bothering other people. So, she had tried playing in the strangest places; a basement, a kitchen, an attic, and even in a shower. But it was no good; there was always someone it would annoy. However, determined to practice as much as she could, brenda spent most of her time playing on books and boxes, and looking for new places to practice. One day, while watching a science documentary on tv, she heard that sound cannot travel in space, because there\'s no air. At that moment, brenda bongos decided to become a sort of musical astronaut. With the help of a lot of time, a lot of books, and a lot of work, brenda built a space bubble. This was a big glass ball connected to a machine which sucked out all the air inside. All that would be left inside was a drum kit and a chair. Brenda got into the space suit she had made, entered the bubble, turned on the machine, and… she played those drums like a wild child! It wasn\'t long before brenda bongos - \'the musical astronaut\' - had become very famous. So many people came to see her play in her space bubble that she had to mount a pair of speakers so that everyone could listen to her play. Shortly afterwards she came out of the bubble and started giving concerts. Her fame spread so much that the government proposed that she form part of a unique space journey. Finally, brenda was a real musical astronaut, and had gone far beyond her first ambition of playing drums in a band. Years later, when they asked her how she had achieved all this, she thought for a moment, and said, "If those old people next-door hadn\'t mattered so much to me, I wouldn\'t have gone to such lengths to find a solution, and none of this would have ever happened."

['Louis was the kind of kid whose favourite activity was lying about staring at the ceiling, or sitting quietly in front of the tv. He knew his parents didn\'t like that he spent so much time like that, but he liked the comfort of that kind of life and, after all, he wasn\'t doing badly at school …one day, while out hiking, louis sat down to rest a while and the next thing he knew, he had lost the rest of the group. But right at that moment, while getting to his feet, he was stunned to see a little dwarf walking quickly through the trees. The dwarf seemed so angry, grumbling and moaning, that he didn\'t realise that a huge boulder was rolling down the hill towards him. And but for the reflexes of louis, who jumped in to save the dwarf, the little guy would have been crushed. After recovering from the shock, the dwarf was so grateful that he insisted he take louis to show him one of the dwarves\' secret places. So off they went through the mountains and arrived at a small clearing. In the middle of the clearing there appeared to be a well. -"This is a magic well," Explained the dwarf. -"Every so often some wonderful gifts come out of it, and whoever is here at the time can use them and enjoy them."Louis didn\'t know whether to believe this story, but at that same moment a really cool bicycle appeared from out of the well. -"Can  I can keep it?" Louis asked. -"Sure, it\'s all yours! enjoy it!"Louis went over and spent a long time looking at the bike, really excited by it. Finally, he got on to try it out. But not for long, because without any warning, the bike disappeared, and louis\' backside hit the dirt. He would have been really angry with the dwarf, had it not been for the fact that the costume of his favourite superhero had just come out of the well, complete with all the accessories. Again, louis spent a long time inspecting everything about the costume. And again, just after he had dressed himself in it and started playing, the gift disappeared. And so it continued. Before his eyes came a procession of all the things louis liked, but not a single one of them stuck around for very long. At first he was angry because he wanted to keep everything to take home, but realising that this wouldn\'t be possible, he contented himself with enjoying each of the wonders provided by the well, until he could do so no longer. He sat down and had a rest with his friend the dwarf, and the dwarf explained that the well had always worked this way, constantly making wonderful gifts, and those gifts always disappeared shortly afterwards. And he told louis how everyone ended up accepting that the well was better that way, offering something new every time. Time passed so quickly that, before they knew it, everyone was out looking for louis. Hearing their shouts, the dwarf ran away, and only had time to say:   -"I can\'t let them see me, and neither can I allow you to remember where this place is. but lest you forget me I\'ll present you with a gift."He handed louis a small parcel, and before disappearing the dwarf said:   -"It\'s a miniature copy of the well, but it\'s just as magical. learn to look at it in the right way, and it will provide you with great joy. goodbye, and thanks for saving me!"With all the commotion that ensued after he was found in the woods, louis forgot about the gift until a few days later. He decided to open it in his room, as if it were a secret, only to discover that the gift was a simple clock with a picture of louis playing near the well. -"The dwarf was kidding me," He thought    -"I knew it would have been too much to get a real copy of that well." So louis sat back on the bed to practice his speciality of whiling away the time. However, when the hand of the clock had turned five minutes, a small glow came out of the clock, and the picture of louis happily playing burst into a thousand pieces, which came back together to form the image of a child looking lonely and bored. The same happened another five minutes later, and every time five more minutes had passed without louis having done anything. Louis began to understand. What if the gifts from the well were the minutes themselves? Was that what the dwarf had been talking about when he said louis needed to learn how to look at the gift properly? That way louis would have everything: time cannot stop, and therefore you have to really make sure you enjoy the gifts you\'re given when they come, because once they go they\'re gone for good and will never return. Then he thought about the minutes he had been given in life, so many of them spent watching television or lying in his room, and those minutes would never return! And he realised that, as with gifts from the well, you had to start enjoying them right away. And ever since that day it was as though there were two or three louis\' in the house. Wherever he was, he learned to open his eyes and to discover in every moment what a fantastic gift he had been given by the well of time. And in this way he learned to read books he would never have read, play games he never would have played, make friends he never would have made, and learning lessons he never would have learned …  he learned to see every thing around him as a gift, a gift to be enjoyed to the maximum. And even when watching tv now, it seemed like he watched it with more interest, because he was no longer willing to waste any of the gifts given by the magic well of time.

['Many years ago, when giants still roamed the earth, there was a particularly frightening and powerful one. But unlike other giants, effort didn\'t spend his time eating people or causing disasters: his sole mission was to defend the entrance to the palace of the wind\'s tears, a magical, wonderful place filled with incredible riches. Many were those who wanted to get their hands on the palace\'s wonders, but to do so they inevitably had to overcome the formidable effort. And he was just invincible in a fight. When anyone would stand in front of the palace\'s great garden, carrying their best weapons, looking for the giant and preparing their strategy, the giant would appear looking quite big, but not too much to take on. However, right from that moment, effort would begin growing and growing, and become faster and faster, smarter and more ferocious, and it was just a matter of time before he would end up crushing his opponents, no matter how many shields and how much armour they had. Even the most learned and intelligent had failed miserably. However much care they took with their tactics and the preparation of their attacks, the ever-growing effort crushed them mercilessly. But all that happened before john. John was a normal guy, not even very clever. Since he had heard that in the palace of wind\'s tears you would find the fountain of success and intelligence, which would provide plenty of these attributes to whoever drank from it, he was determined to fight the giant. So, thinking he wouldn\'t be capable of preparing a battle based on cunning, nor of inventing the best of strategies, he arrived at the palace and before the giant came into view, john rushed through the gardens at top speed, shouting:   -"Effort! effort! where are you? I\'m going to crush you!"Splat! Wow! How strange! In the middle of the most important battle of his life john had just stepped on a dog poo …but when he made to clean the shoe, the young man realised it wasn\'t that at all. He had stepped on what looked like a bug. And looking at it more closely, john saw that whatever it was looked just like the giant, but it was tiny. John waited a good while for effort to appear, but nothing happened. It couldn\'t be that the giant had not heard john\'s cries to come and fight, so john finally understood what had happened. He\'d been the first to defeat the giant! He had squashed the giant like a worm! Proud and satisfied with his achievement, he entered the palace. Just as people had told him, in that place he found success, intelligence, and many other things. He met the queen of the winds, who told him that she herself had created effort in the form of a small, weak creature who got bigger and bigger with the more fear and time his opponents spent on thinking about him, and that the secret to returning to the palace whenever john wanted was to not give effort even a second to grow. And to this day effort continues protecting most of the good things in life. But all you have to do is avoid giving him even a second to grow. Fight him instantly to overcome him.

['One day, a train was approaching the small town of cheekyville. On the train was a strange guy with a big suitcase. He was called william warbler - the man, not the suitcase - and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera. It didn\'t matter to william whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like \'good day\'. He would clear his voice and respond,"Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu….. toooooo!"It wouldn\'t be unfair to say that almost everyone considered william warbler a massive pain in the neck. No one could get a normal, spoken, word out of him. And, as no one knew how he made his living - and he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit - they often treated him with disdain. They made fun of his singing, calling him \'don no one\', \'poor-rotti\', and \'lazy miserables\'. William had been in cheekyville for some years, when, one day, a rumour spread round town like wildfire: william had secured a role in a very important opera in the nation\'s capital, and there were posters everywhere advertising the event. Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. At the end of its run - to everyone in cheekyville\'s surprise -  when william was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great courtesy, and with a clears and pleasant voice. From that day, william gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others still had no idea, and continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn\'t have thought so if they had seen what william kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved message on it. The message said: "Practice, my boy. practice every second, for you never know when your chance will come."Little did people realise that he only got the role in the opera because the director had heard william singing while out buying a newspaper.

['Once, there were several researchers in the forest, trying to study the rarest beast in the world. No one had seen it, and its existence was only known by some remains, and by its highly characteristic call. The call was similar to that of a dog with a toothache: "Oooh..wa-oooooh!"Everyone wanted to be the first to photograph and study it. The \'beast\' was a nocturnal creature, so during the day the scientists would pass their time studying other matters or in discussion. The most remarkable of them was sir walter tick-fondler. He was a very pleasant and reliable chap, with a tiny little moustache and a huge explorer\'s hat. Every day, before tea, he would spend an hour sitting at his desk, putting all his equipment and bits and pieces in their proper place. He did this with meticulous precision. The notebook went right at the far edge of the desk, on the right hand side, slightly beyond the recorder, and next to the five pencils which were always in the same order: black, red, blue, green and yellow. The lamp was always towards the end of the desk, next to the camera, on the left… and so it was with all his things, even with the smallest of details. Everyone was amused that this gentleman was such a perfect example of the famous english obsession with order. The researchers spent many nights in that area before the creature appeared, and before it did so some of them even doubted its existence. It appeared suddenly, while everything was quiet. Only a few metres away, the scientists heard its call loud and clear. The famous call of the dog with a toothache. It lasted only an instant, because all the commotion of the researchers scrabbling for their cameras and notebooks scared the creature, and it shot off before it could apparently be seen or studied in any detail. The next morning they all compared their findings. Some had managed to record its call, others had noted down how it moved, and the most fortunate of all had even managed to photograph parts of its tail or legs. They all congratulated each other on what they had got, but when they saw what sir walter had they were shocked. He had taken several complete photos, as well as recording its cry, and making full-colour annotations on the creature! And they were all perfect! They ran to congratulate him as the best researcher of them all. They now understood that his obsession with order had been the best way to prepare himself for working in the dark. This had meant sir walter had no problem in finding and using the recorder, the camera, the notebook and the pencils, all in just fractions of a second and without having to look for them. Of course, the work he did on \'the rarest creature in the world\' made sir walter famous. He founded a successful school for researchers and scientists called ioto: \'in order to investigate\', and had the honour of naming the animal. And as it had all been such fun and he so enjoyed the field trip, after recording that characteristic call, he didn\'t hesitate to name the animal the \'whatahoot\'.

["There was once a bat for whom having to go out and hunt insects was just a terrible amount of effort. He was such a lover of comfort that, one day, when he happened to look through a window and saw a bird in its cage, and that it was given all its food and water without having to do anything at all, the bat decided to become a child's pet. The bat changed his whole routine. He got up at dawn to fly to parks so he could be spotted by some child who might adopt him as a pet. However, as bats aren't particularly attractive, the children paid him little attention. So the bat decided to improve his appearance.

But that feeling lasted only up to the time he started feeling hungry.

["Lulu and lily were two spinach plants who were born on the same vegetable patch. They had been friends all their lives. Together they had endured terrible frosts, snowstorms, and scorching hot summer days. Through it all they had always supported each other, looking forward to the time every spinach plant dreams of: the moment they are served on a child's dinner plate, the moment they get to pass on all their gathered strength. So when harvest time arrived, lulu and lily were happy at being sent together to the spinach preparation factory, and then on to the packaging company and to the supermarket. At the supermarket they sat together, displayed on one of the very best shelves. They were both excited to see ladies passing by with their baskets. They were especially thrilled when any lady with a child came nearby.

Lulu fell to the floor, right in front of the lady, and the lady's foot kicked lulu under the stack of shelves.

['One day for the first time, I was preparing fresh lime water. While preparing I ended up adding five time the lemon juice amount than it needed. Resulting lime water was disaster. It was so sour that no one could even take one sip of it. Now, I had to make it right anyhow. I wish if I could remove extra lemon juice from the water but some things can never be undone. There is no way to remove lemon juice from the water. So what\'s solution? The only way to correct it was to add four more glasses of water to the already made lime water and dilute the lemon juice to make five glasses of fresh lime water. Now, if we think about life it\'s same. Sometimes we do things which cannot be undone. Some wrong decisions, wrong choices, wrong doings, wrong actions can never be undone. So what\'s solution? When we cannot undo things and correct what ever wrong happened, we should not waste more time over it. It would be like trying to remove lemon juice from lime water. Instead, if things get wrong and cannot be undone then we should get busy in adding so many right things in our life that wrong seems insignificant. We all have negative sides to ourselves and we may not be able to correct all our negativities but we can definitely try to continue adding positive thoughts, actions, people in our lives and dilute negativity. We all have been through lows in our life and we cannot change that but if we add new highs in our life, we will be able to dilute lows. Isn\'t it? In the end life will seem "Mostly high". We all had mistakes in our life and have bitter memories but we can get busy making and adding new happy memories now. We should try to do a lot of good things and concentrate on making life more positive today so that we can dilute bad things which ever happened or done by us in past.

He boiled the milk, drank some of it and put the remaining milk in a pot. He added slight curds in the pot for converting the milk to curd. He then lay down to sleep. Soon he started imagining about the pot of curd while he lay asleep. He dreamed that if he could become rich somehow all his miseries would be gone. His thoughts turned to the pot of milk he had set to form curd. He dreamed on; "By morning the pot of milk would set, it would be converted to curd. I would churn the curd and make butter from it. I would heat the butter and make ghee out of it. I will then go to that market and sell that ghee, and make some money. with that money I will buy a hen. the hen will lay may eggs which will hatch and there will be many chicken. these chicken will in turn lay hundreds of eggs and I will soon have a poultry farm of my own." He kept on imagining. "I will sell all the hens of my poultry and buy some cows, and open a milk dairy. all the town people will buy milk from me. I will be very rich and soon I shall buy jewels. the king will buy all the jewels from me. I will be so rich that I will be able to marry an exceptionally beautiful girl from a rich family. soon I will have a handsome son. if he does any mischief I will be very angry and to teach him a lesson, I will hit him with a big stick."During this dream, he involuntarily picked up the stick next to his bed and thinking that he was beating his son, raised the stick and hit the pot. The pot of milk broke and he awoke from his day dream. ', 'There is no substitute for hard work. Dreams cannot be fulfilled without hard work. ', 10]

['A merchant, driving his ass homeward from the seashore with a heavy load of salt, came to a river crossed by a shallow ford. They had crossed this river many times before without accident, but this time the ass slipped and fell when halfway over. And when the merchant at last got him to his feet, much of the salt had melted away. Delighted to find how much lighter his burden had become, the ass finished the journey very gayly. Next day the merchant went for another load of salt. On the way home the ass, remembering what had happened at the ford, purposely let himself fall into the water, and again got rid of most of his burden. The angry merchant immediately turned about and drove the ass back to the seashore, where he loaded him with two great baskets of sponges.

The farmer was very sad that his sons were so lazy. One day farmer became very ill. He called his three sons to tell them something. The three boys went to the field and dug in the ground.

['There wasn\'t a single soul on the beach who hadn\'t heard of crazyclaws, the formidable enemy of toes and the most feared crab on this side of the ocean. Every year an absent-minded tourist would fall foul of a great big pinch that made them leave and not want to come back. Scared swimmers would often get together to try and catch the crab but every time they thought they had succeeded, the pinches returned to let them know they had caught the wrong crab. Crazyclaws had a mean streak but he was also very clever. Instead of concealing himself and going unnoticed like all the other crabs, he would hide in the sand and prepare his attack. Crazyclaws was a little resentful because, as a baby crab, he was stepped on by a child and had lost a leg. It grew back but it was shorter than his other legs and he got very angry and upset every time he looked at it. He was thinking about how mean swimmers could be when he spotted his next victim. It was a big fat shiny toe and its owner was barely moving. \'how easy! \' he thought. Now he could pinch with all his strength. He remembered the different steps he had to follow: emerge, move forward, pinch, release, retreat, and disappear into the sand again. Go get\'em!! Something went wrong, however. Crazyclaws got stuck on the fourth step and was unable to release the toe. His pinch was so strong that he had broken through the skin and got stuck in the flesh. Flesh? It couldn\'t be, there was no blood. Only then did crazyclaws realise it was a trap! But crazyclaws was exaggerating as always. He thought that no one could be so smart as to trap him with a fake toe. The fake toe did belong to someone though: a girl called vera, who lost her leg in an accident when she was little. She didn\'t realise that crazyclaws was attached to her toe until she came out of the water to go and play in the sand. She released the crab, but he didn\'t run off because he was scared to death. Vera discovered that crazyclaws had a shorter leg and she felt sorry for him, so she decided to help him. She made him a wonderful little house using rocks and fetched him small animals to eat. What a feast! This girl sure can look after a crab. She was happy, fun and - most importantly - she put him back in the sea before leaving. "What a lovely girl" He thought that night. "I\'d like to be just as nice as her. if only I didn\'t have this little leg …". It was at that moment that he realised that vera\'s leg had never grown back and that children aren\'t like crabs. They only have two legs and yet she was still really nice. He could certainly be a happy crab even though he had been through very difficult times. The very next day and every day after that during that summer, crazyclaws attacked vera\'s toe again so he could play with her all day. Together they learned how to turn pinches into tickles and a bad temper into a laughter and glee. In the end, vera\'s crab became very famous on that beach, though nobody suspected that it was actually crazyclaws. It was better that way because there were still people who had not learnt that you don\'t need to be resentful and bad tempered, no matter how badly you are pinched by a crab.

['Xt-27 wasn\'t just any robot. His identification plate read "Xt-27: the best, most modern robot". He was, indeed, the most up-to-date robot currently available, a product difficult to beat. Of course, this made him feel very proud. So much so, that when he saw other robots in the street, he would look at them with a certain air of superiority; he reserved his enthusiastic greetings for other xt-27s. "All robots should be like us xt-27s", he thought to himself. He was convinced that no new robot would be able to improve on the xt-27 model, and that the world would be a much better place if all robots were like himself. One day, he was walking along in bionic city, when a big yellow door suddenly appeared, about an inch in front of his piezoelectric optical sensors. He had no idea where the door had come from, but thanks to being an xt-27, his quick reactions allowed him to avoid walking straight into it. Intrigued, he pulled it open and went through the doorway. The door led to a fantastic city. All the city\'s inhabitants were xt-27s, and everything he saw there was mindblowing! Excited at having found his perfect city, he set to exploring the whole place, stopping from time to time to talk to people, telling them what a great thing it was to be an xt-27. Finally, he moved into his moulded fibreglass bubble , on the outskirts of the city. The days passed, but he suddenly realised that there was something about that city that he didn\'t like. As all the robots were xt-27s, it meant that no one had any reason to feel better or more up-to-date than anyone else, and, in fact, nobody did. No one looked down on others, and, if truth be told, he found that with the passing of time not even he felt special any more. On top of that, things became very boring. Everyone could do things equally well, which made it impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. Whenever he did anything which he thought brilliant, it turned out that the other robots had done exactly the same thing and at the same time. So xt-27 started to miss those varied little robots in his previous world. Each one had had its good and bad points, but that made them different and fun. He realised that he would much prefer to meet a clumsy-but-fun tp-4, and spend a while chatting with it, than see yet another xt-27. So he started searching for that big yellow door. It took him several days to find it, but finally he did. Just like before, it was standing in the middle of a normal street. He put his hand on the door and looked behind him, as if saying farewell to the city that had at first seemed so perfect. Then, he gave the door a joyful push… when he woke up, the xt-27 was on the ground, and some people were helping him to his feet. He looked around, and there was no yellow door at all. Instead there was an enormous shiny yellow robot. The xt-27 had bumped into it so violently that the jolt had made his circuits malfunction. The xt-27, surprised at not having managed to avoid the collision, looked carefully at that formidable-looking robot. He had never seen one like it. It seemed perfect in every way. It was taller and more powerful than any other, and its identification plate read: "Xt-28, the best, most modern robot". So they had done it. The seemingly impossible had happened. The xt-27s were no longer the best robots of all. Even so, our friend didn\'t feel the slightest sadness. Seconds earlier, when dreaming about the perfect city, he had learnt that he was very happy to be different, and that it was great to have hundreds of different robots; each one with its very own good and bad points. ', 'We cannot hope to be the best at everything, nor that everyone else be just like us. Every individual contributes something of value. ', 10]
["Once upon a time a boy was walking through a little forest when he found a big blackboard hanging on an old tree trunk. It came complete with a box of chalk pieces, and bright sparks were flying from the tips of every piece of chalk. The boy took a piece of chalk and started to draw on the board: first a tree, then a rabbit, then a flower…magically, whenever he finished a figure it came to life and jumped out of the board. Before long, the place had become a wonderfully green and fertile forest, full of animals happily playing. Excited, the boy also drew his parents and brothers and sisters enjoying a picnic, with their sandwiches and cold meats. He also drew the paper plates and the empty tins of sardines left on the ground, which always happened on their picnics. But when these bits of litter came to life something awful happened: around every paper plate and every empty tin, the forest turned grey, and this greyness started quickly spreading everywhere: to the grass, to the flowers, to the animals… the boy realised the litter was to blame for all the greyness, so he ran through the forest with the blackboard rubber in his hand to rub them out wherever they had landed. He was lucky. He was quick, and didn't leave a single piece of litter. The forest and its animals managed to recover, and they played together for the rest of the day.

A crow came through the air, and flying near, exclaimed: "You really have carried off a rich prize in your talons; but if I don\'t instruct you what you must do, in vain will you tire yourself with the heavy weight." A share being promised her, she persuades the eagle to dash the hard shell from the lofty stars upon a rock, that, it being broken to pieces, she may easily feed upon the meat. Induced by her words, the eagle attends to her suggestion, and at the same time gives a large share of the banquet to her instructress.

['There was a salt vendor in a village. He used to buy salt from a nearby town. He had a donkey to carry this salt load. There were many streams to be crossed to reach the town. One day, the vendor was returning after his purchase. The donkey was loaded with salt bags. While they were crossing a stream, accidentally the donkey slipped and fell into the stream. A lot of salt got dissolved in the water. When the donkey got up the load became very light. From that day, whenever the vendor returned from town after salt purchase, the donkey began to tumble half-way across one stream or the other. The vendor became suspicious. Once the vendor purchased bales of cotton and loaded his donkey with bales of cotton. The donkey felt the load to be unusually light. He thought "Today, I am going to tumble and this load is going to become much lighter". On their way home, as usual, the donkey tumbled and fell into a stream. But alas! When the donkey tried to get up, the load pulled the donkey down. The cotton had absorbed water and become heavier. The vendor gave hard beatings to make the donkey get up and walk. From then on, the donkey never tumbled while crossing streams. ', 'Avoiding work leads to more work. ', 10]
['Once upon a time there was a girl who, though of humble origin, was so incredibly beautiful that she was famed throughout the region. Knowing how much the young men of the kingdom liked her, she rejected all her suitors, waiting for the arrival of some handsome prince. Well, it didn\'t take long for a handsome prince to come by, and as soon as he saw the young girl he fell for her and showered her with compliments and gifts. The wedding was extravagant, and everyone said they made the perfect couple. However, when the shine and excitement of the presents and the parties began to wear off, the young princess found out that her handsome young husband wasn\'t as wonderful as she had expected. He behaved like a tyrant towards his people, he boasted about his wife as though she was a hunting trophy, and he was selfish and mean. When she came to see that everything about her husband was a false appearance, she didn\'t hesitate to tell him this to his face, but he answered her back in a similar vein, reminding her that he had only chosen her for her beauty, and that she could have chosen many others rather than himself, if she hadn\'t let herself be carried away by ambition and her desire to live in a palace. The princess cried for days, seeing the truth in her husband\'s cruel words. She remembered all the many good and honest young men she\'d rejected only so she could become a princess. Wanting to undo her mistake, the princess tried to leave the palace, but the prince wouldn\'t allow her, since everyone talked about the extraordinary beauty of his wife, and this added to the prince\'s reputation as an exceptional man. The princess made so many attempts to escape that she ended up locked away, constantly watched by guards. One of those guards felt pity for the princess, and in her captivity he tried to cheer her up and provide some company and conversation for her. As time passed they were becoming good friends. They came to have such confidence in each other that one day the princess asked the guard to allow her to escape. But the soldier, who owed loyalty and obedience to his king did not agree to the princess\' plea. Nevertheless, he answered her, saying:   -"If you so want to flee from here, I know how to do it, but it will call for a great sacrifice on your part."She agreed, confirming that she was willing to do anything, and so the soldier continued:   -"The prince only wants you for your beauty. if you disfigure your face he will send you far away from the palace so no one can see you, and he\'ll erase any trace of your presence. that\'s just the despicable, miserable kind of man he is."The princess replied, saying:   -"Disfigure myself? and where will I go to? what will become of me, if my beauty is all I have? who would want to have anything to do with a horribly ugly and useless woman like me?" -"I would," The soldier answered, confidently. His daily talks with the princess had led him to fall in love with her. -"To me you are even more beautiful on the inside than on the outside."And at that moment the princess realised that she too loved that simple and honest soldier. With tears in her eyes she took the hand of her guard, and with his dagger in both their hands, they made two long, deep cuts in her face…when the prince saw his wife\'s face everything happened just as the guard had predicted. The prince sent her as far away as he could, and he made up a tragic story about her death which made him even more popular among the people. And so, disfigured and free, the girl with the beautiful face could finally be happy alongside that simple and loyal soldier. He was the only person who, looking at her, would not quickly look away, since in that face he always found the path to his heart.

["Brian bristles was an artistic kind of a boy. He looked at everything as though it were a beautiful painting, and, in the blink of an eye, he could paint anything at all, filling it with magic and colour. One day, brian and his grandfather went to spend a weekend at the palace of the marquis of castling. The marquis was an old friend of brian's grandfather; and was a very famous chess player. When they arrived, brian went into a large room and found a lovely chess set, totally hand carved, and with its own marble table which acted as the board. This chess set caught brian's artistic eye. However, he felt that these pieces were too uniform. Along with the blacks and whites of the board, it amounted to rather a bland set. So, that night, - paint box in hand - he tiptoed from his room to the chess room. There he spent the night painting each piece in the most colourful way. When the pieces were done, he painted a beautiful scene on the marble chessboard. Brian hoped to use his art to really surprise his grandfather and the marquis. However, the next morning, when the marquis discovered that his pieces had been covered in a thousand colours, instead of being pleased, he was very angry. That afternoon he had a very important match to play. However lovely all those colours were, it would be impossible to play chess without being able to know which pieces were which; and even more difficult now that the squares of the board were covered with a painting. Brian's grandfather explained to him that even the loveliest, most colourful things need some sense of order to them. The boy felt very hurt, remembering how many times his paintings had annoyed people…but brian bristles was a true artist, and he wasn't about to give up easily. A little while later he went to his grandfather and the marquis, and asked their permission to rectify what he had done to the chess set. Knowing how ingeniously artistic the boy was, they decided to give him a chance, so brian went off and spent hours alone with his paints. When he was finished, shortly before the match was about to begin, he called for the two men and showed them his work. What a beautiful chess set it now was! Now there were two perfectly recognisable teams; that of night and that of day. On one side, the board and the pieces had been decorated with dozens of stars and moons of all sizes and colours. On the other side the decorations were suns, clouds, and rainbows. It was done so well that the whole set had an unmatchable sense of order and harmony. Brian understood that a little order had been missing, but he had now managed to impose some without giving up any colour. The two grown-ups looked at the paintings and smiled. It was obvious that brian bristles would become a great artist. ", "All things require a minimum of order, although that doesn't prevent the order from being applied with imagination. ", 10]
["The day finally arrived. It was time for the great acrobatic balloon competition. Every insect in the garden had been training hard, and now they were preparing to begin their routines. The balloon competitions were always something really special, since they could only happen after the children of the house had had some big party. There was only a short window of opportunity too, before the parents came round to collect up the balloons. Each time, the flying insects were favourites to win, because they could grab the balloon strings and fly off in all directions, creating all sorts of patterns in the air. However, on this occasion there were some rather unusual insects taking part: a group of ants. Of course, no one expected that they'd do anything special. They were so light that no ant had ever bothered to take part, but it was quite impressive to see all the ants all perfectly organised and prepared. So the competition began, and the different insects took their turns, performing beautiful manoeuvres with the balloons. As always, the butterfly and the firefly left everyone amazed with their twist and turns, and their wonderful colours. When it was time for the ants to perform, it seemed like the competition had already been decided. For the first time in living memory, the ants shared just one balloon between them, and one by one they climbed up the balloon string; forming a thin black thread of ants. When all the string was covered, the last ant climbed over his teammates to reach the balloon. Once there, he climbed onto the top of the balloon. This strange spectacle attracted everyone's curiosity, and they were just about to witness the most important moment: the ant opened his jaws as wide as he could… and then he stabbed the balloon with all his might! Pssshhhhhhh! !! The result was tremendous! The balloon began blowing out its air, flying madly about, here and there, doing a thousand pirouettes, while the perfectly synchronised ants, made all kinds of beautiful shapes out of the string. Of course, that acrobatic flight ended with quite a hard landing, but it didn't matter. The originality and teamwork of the ant performance was so impressive that the crowd didn't even have to vote for there to be a winner. From then on, in that garden, everyone understood how much could be achieved by working together. In the years to come, the balloon competitions were full of displays carried out by teams, and they put on some wonderful routines; something those individual insects could never have achieved on their own. ", 'If you work together in a team you can achieve much more than you could have done on your own. ', 10]
['Once, a group of boys decided to play a proper soccer game. Each one of them would bring something used in professional matches. So one would bring the ball, another the whistle, another the goalposts, others the goalkeeper gloves, the corner flags, etc… but before the game started, while they were picking the teams, there was a slight argument. They decided that the boy who had brought the most important object would get to pick the teams. Well, now they couldn\'t decide which had been the most important object, so they thought it would be best to just start playing, using all the objects, and gradually get rid of what people had brought, to see which things were truly indispensable. The first thing they got rid of was the whistle, because the referee could just shout instead. Then they tossed the goalkeeper gloves; they managed to save the ball just as well without them. Neither did they really notice when they stopped using the corner flags, nor when they replaced the goalposts with a couple of bins. And so they continued, until finally they replaced the football with an old tin, and managed to keep playing…while they were playing with the tin, a man and his son passed by. Seeing the boys playing like that, the man said to his son:   "Look, son. learn from those kids over there. without even a ball they\'re managing to play football, even though they\'re never going to be able to improve playing that way." The boys heard him say this, and realised that because of their excessive pride and egotism, what could have been a great match had turned into a shameful display, which they were hardly enjoying at all. That moment, they decided to put their selfish opinions to one side, and they agreed to start playing the match again, from the start, and with all the proper equipment. And it really was a great game. No one thought about who was playing better or worse. Rather, they just concentrated on having fun and improving their game.

['There was once a little bird who was very nice, but very, very lazy. Every day, when it was time to get up, they had to shout at him again and again before he would finally struggle out of bed. And when there was some job he had to do, he would keep putting it off until there was hardly enough time left to do it. People kept telling him "What a lazy bird you are! you can\'t just keep leaving everything to the last minute". "Bah! there\'s really no problem", answered the little bird, "I just take a bit longer to get around to doing things, that\'s all". The birds spent all summer flying and playing, and when autumn came and you could start feeling the cold, they began to prepare for the long journey to a warmer land. But our little bird, lazy as ever, kept putting it off, feeling quite sure that there would be plenty of time to prepare for the journey. That was, until one day when he woke up and all the other birds were gone. Just like every other day, several of his friends had tried to wake him, but - half asleep - he told them he would get up later. He had gone back to sleep and only woke up again much later. That day was the day of the great journey. Everyone knew the rules: you had to be ready to leave; there were thousands of birds, and they weren\'t going to wait around for anyone. So the little bird, who didn\'t know how to make the journey alone, realised that because of his laziness, he would have to spend the long cold winter all on his own. At the beginning, he spent a lot of time crying, but he had to admit that it was his own fault. He knew he could do things well when he put his mind to it so, putting his laziness aside, he began to prepare for the winter. First, he spent days looking for the place that was best protected from the cold. He found a place between some rocks, and there he made a new nest, well built with branches, stones and leaves. Then, he worked tirelessly to fill the nest with fruits and berries, enough to last the whole winter. Finally, he dug a little pool in the cave, so he would have enough water. When he saw that his new home was perfectly prepared, he began to train himself on how to get by on very little food and water, so that he would be able to endure the worst snowstorms. And, although many would not have believed it, all these preparations meant that the little bird did survive through the winter. Of course, he suffered greatly, and not a day of that winter went by without him regretting having been such a lazy little bird. When the spring finally arrived, and his old friends returned from their voyage, they were all filled with joy and surprise at seeing that the little bird was still alive. They could hardly believe that such a lazy bird had managed to build such a wonderful nest. And when they realised that not even a bit of laziness remained in his little body, and that he had turned into the most hard-working bird of the flock, everyone agreed that he should be put in charge of organising the great journey next year. When that time came, everything was so well done and so well prepared that they even had time left to invent an early morning wake-up song, so that from that day on no little bird, however lazy, would have to spend the winter alone again.

['There was once an elephant who wanted to be a photographer. How his friends would laugh when they heard him talk about it! - "How silly," Said some, "There aren\'t any cameras for elephants!" - "What a waste of time," Others would say, "There\'s nothing to photograph here anyway…"But the elephant kept following his dream, and, piece by piece, he managed to cobble together some old bits of junk and some spare parts, and ended up with a camera of sorts. With this camera, the elephant had to design practically everything himself, from a button he pressed with the end of his trunk, to a lens made to fit an elephant\'s eye, to a load of wrought iron used to make a frame so the elephant could attach the camera to his head. When it was all finished, he could finally get to taking his first photos. However, the elephant camera was so enormous and strange-looking that it seemed like some huge ridiculous mask. So many people laughed as he went by that the elephant began to think of abandoning his dream… even worse, it was beginning to look like those who had said there was nothing to photograph there had been right…but things worked out differently. The sight of the elephant walking about with the camera on his head was so funny that no one could help but laugh when they saw him. And, using a great deal of good humour, the elephant managed to take some really amusing, incredible pictures of all the animals. In his photos they always looked joyful; even the moody rhino! So the elephant managed to become the official savannah photographer, and animals would come from every direction to have some nice photos taken for their passport to the zoo.

["There was once a leopard in the jungle; and a very nocturnal leopard he was too. He could hardly sleep at night and, lying on a branch of his magnificent tree, he spent his time watching what was happening in the forest at night. This is how he came to learn that there was a thief in that forest. He would watch the thief go out every night with empty hands and return loaded up with his stolen loot. Sometimes the thief had nabbed the senior monkey's bananas, other times he had filched the lion's wig, or pinched the zebra's stripes. One night he even snuck home with the big elephant's false tusk, which the elephant had been secretly wearing for quite some time. However, as the leopard was a very quiet sort of cat, who lived at the margin of everything, he didn't want to say anything to anyone. He didn't see it as his business, and, if truth were told, he rather enjoyed discovering these little secrets. And so, thanks to the stealthy thief, quite a stir was being created in the world of the animals: the elephant felt ridiculous without his false tusk, and the zebra now looked like a white donkey, not to mention the lion who, now as bald as a lioness had lost all respect.

Well this was the last straw, so the leopard, taking advantage of the thief not being there, ran out and went straight to see the other animals to tell them where the thief had hidden all their things… they all praised the leopard for having discovered the thief and his hideout, and allowing them to recover their possessions. In the end, the animal who lost most from all this was the leopard, who couldn't replant his magnificent tree and had to make do with a much inferior tree located in a very boring site… and he regretted having not been concerned at the problems of the other animals, now seeing that in the long run those very problems had become his own.

['There was once a king who had a great palace with wonderful gardens. In those gardens there lived thousands of creatures from hundreds of different species. They were of great variety and colour, and they turned that place into a kind of paradise that everyone could enjoy. There was only one thing in those gardens that the king disliked: near the centre stood the remains of what had been, centuries ago, a huge tree, but that now was withered and dry, and detracted from the colour and beauty of its surroundings. This bothered the king so much that he finally ordered it to be cut down and replaced by a beautiful series of fountains. Some time later, a wise noble was visiting the king at his palace. He whispered in the king\'s ear:   -"Majesty, you are the wisest of men. everywhere one hears talk of the beauty of these gardens and the multitude of creatures that populate them. but during the time I\'ve spent here, I\'ve hardly seen anything other than this fountain and just a few small birds… what a deception!"The king, who never tried to deceive anyone, found, to his horror, that what the noble had told him was true. They had spent so many months admiring the fountains that they hadn\'t realised that hardly any animals remained in the gardens. Without wasting time he sent for the court\'s experts and advisers. The king had to listen to many lies, inventions and assumptions, but nothing could explain what had happened. Not even the great reward offered by the king managed to recuperate the royal gardens\' former splendour. Many years later, a young man presented himself to the king, assuring him that he could explain what had happened, and how the animals could be returned. -"What happened with your garden is that there just wasn\'t enough poo, your majesty. particularly moth poo."All those present laughed at the young man\'s joke. The guards got ready to throw him out, but the king stopped them. -"I want to hear what you have to say. from the thousand lies I\'ve heard, none have begun like that."The young man continued, very serious, and started explaining how the gardens\' big animals fed mainly on the little brightly-coloured birds, who owed their appearance to their own food, composed of colourful worms, who in turn fed on various rare species of plants and flowers that could only grown in that part of the world, just so long as there was enough moth poo for them… and so he continued, telling how the moths were the basis of much food for many other birds, whose poo encouraged the appearance of new species of plants that fed other insects and animals, and which were, in turn, vital to the existence of other species… and the young man would have kept speaking without pause if the king had not shouted. -"Enough! and can you tell me how you know all these things, being so young?" Asked the king. -"Well, because now all from your garden are at my house. before I was born my father collected that old tree you had torn out from the middle of the garden, and he planted it in our garden. since then, every spring, from out of that tree come thousands and thousands of moths. with time, the moths attracted the birds, and new plants and trees grew, providing food for other animals that, in turn, provided food for others… and now, my father\'s old place is filled with life and colour. all thanks to the moths from the big old tree." -"Excellent!" Exclaimed the king, -"Now I\'ll be able to recover my gardens. and you, I\'ll make you rich. rest assured that within a week everything will be ready. use as many men as you like." -"Your majesty, I\'m afraid that cannot be," Said the young man, -"If you like I can try to recreate the gardens, but you will not live to see it. it will take many years for the natural balance to reestablish itself. with great good fortune perhaps I, when I\'m old, will see it completed. things like these do not depend on how many men work on them."The face of the old king was sad and pensive, understanding how delicate was the balance of nature, and how careless it had been to break it so happily. But he so loved those gardens and those creatures that he decided to build a huge palace next to the young man\'s land. And with thousands of men working on the construction, he managed to see the palace finished in much less time than would have been necessary to reestablish the balance of nature of that garden in any other place.

['"How could anyone sneezes in front of a magic book! oh no! the letters have been blown off!" Growled mama troll. "Just as we were so close to finding the spell that would make us look nice…", sighed papa troll. "How have the letters fallen?" Asked trollita, "Can you still read the book? does it make sense?""Hmm, let me see…even worse! it\'s useless, it\'s turned into a cookbook…ugh! what a disaster!" Grunted papa troll, throwing the book out of the window. It was only natural for them to be angry. The troll family had lived a great adventure to find that magic book. It was their only hope of stopping scaring everyone with their horrible looks. A book of magic is very delicate and papa troll was such a brute …the book was ruined so they all had to accept the way they looked and carry on with their lives. As they didn\'t have any other books, little trollita decided to keep it and make some of the recipes. "Ugh! we don\'t like this food. from now on you will eat whatever you make from that book by yourself." Shouted mama and papa troll. Some time later, a brave knight in shining armour passed by. He saw trollita with her parents and shouted, "Fear not, princess, for I will help you escape from these horrible trolls!"However, it was the knight who could not escape from a good whack. He was still on the ground when trollita saw a reflection in his armour. Given that all the mirrors in her house had been broken for a long time, she felt a little curious. She moved closer to see her own reflection and couldn\'t believe her eyes: she looked like a normal girl! She looked again and again, it had to be her. How had she turned into this? The confusion did not last long and they soon discovered that none of them were trolls. They ate so little fruit and vegetables that they had been unable to see properly, and their cuts never healed fully, nor did anything… that\'s why they looked so bad! And, of course, as soon as trollita started eating the recipes from the healthy cookbook, she looked lovely! "We would have preferred to use the magic to stop looking like trolls but eating your recipes won\'t be that difficult," Said trollita\'s parents. Needless to say, it did not prove difficult and they soon got used to the food and actually enjoyed it too. And when they had learnt all the recipes from the book, they went in search of a child that hated healthy food and gave it to them to stop them looking like a troll too.

At first he turned to flee, but finding that the lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of androcles like a dog.

["There was once a clown named lemon. He was a lot of fun, but also very careless. Whenever he did anything, he almost always ended up tearing his jacket, getting a hole in his sock, or ripping the knee of his trousers. Everyone said he should take more care, but lemon found that really boring. So, one day, he had the happy idea of buying himself a sewing machine. This machine was so fantastic that it sewed everything up within a moment. It seemed like lemon wouldn't have to worry about his things anymore. Soon, the most important day in lemon's life arrived. It was the day when everyone in town prepared a party for him, in celebration of lemon's many years of service in making the citizens chuckle. On that day he wouldn't have to wear his colourful clown suit. That day he would be dressed like anyone else; very elegantly in his suit, and everyone commenting on his smart appearance. However, the night before, he had a look in his closet, and there wasn't a single suit in good condition. They were all ripped and torn, with dozens of stitching marks. Lemon couldn't possibly go to the party dressed in those. Well, lemon was sharp and quick-witted, and he solved this problem by attending the gala celebration in his usual clown suit. That definitely amused the audience, but lemon wasn't as keen on it. He had dreamed of being, just for one day in the year, the hero of the show, and not just the clown. Very early the next day, lemon replaced all those damaged old suits, and since then, he has looked after his clothes with great care. He realised that using short-term remedies ends up being no remedy at all. ", 'Trying to continually cover up faults, ends up with there being no way to conceal them when it is most important. ', 12]
['One day, mister arnold was teaching a lesson, and things were going as normally as ever. He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils. He told them that, in the beginning, men were nomads; that they never stayed in the same place for very long. Instead, they would travel about, here and there, in search of food, wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out, they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals. This was an important discovery, because by learning to cultivate the land, and care for animals, mankind would always have food readily available. It also meant that people could remain living in one place, and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete, like building towns, cities, and all that was in them. All the children were listening, spellbound by this story, until lucy jumped up:"And if that was so important, and improved everything so much, why are we nomads all over again, mister arnold?"Mister arnold didn\'t know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl. He knew that she lived with her parents in a house, so she must know that her family were not nomads; so what did she mean? "We have all become nomads again," Continued lucy, "The other day, outside the city, they were cutting the forest down. a while ago a fisherman told me how they fish. it\'s the same with everyone: when there\'s no more forest left the foresters go elsewhere, and when the fish run out the fishermen move on. that\'s what the nomads did, isn\'t it?" The teacher nodded, thoughtfully. Really, lucy was right. Mankind had turned into nomads. Instead of looking after the land in a way that we could be sure it would keep supplying our needs, we kept exploiting it until the land was bare and barren. And then off we would go to the next place! The class spent the rest of the afternoon talking about what they could do to demonstrate how to be more civilised…the next day everyone attended class wearing a green t-shirt, with a message that said "I am not a nomad!"And, from then on, they set about showing that indeed they were not. Every time they knew they needed something, they made sure that they would get it using care and restraint. If they needed wood or paper, they would ensure that they got the recycled kind. They ordered their fish from fish farms, making sure that the fish they received were not too young and too small. They only used animals that were well cared for, and brought up on farms…and so, from their little town, those children managed to give up being nomads again, just as prehistoric men had done, so many thousands of years ago.

The bird was so heavy that she had to walk along the ground. Despite this, though, she enjoyed looking up at the trees every day, dreaming of one day being able to fly and enjoy viewing the beautiful countryside from up high.

The stone bird was the only form of life able to survive the fire, but when she saw what had become of the forest, she was overcome with sadness, and couldn't stop crying.

When fakir met queen, he said, "What do you want?"Queen replied, "I want your begging bowl."Without asking anything, fakir gave it, only thing he had. Queen took that and in return gave him golden bowl, studded with diamonds. Queen said, "Thank you. I will worship this begging bowl that you have carried for years. it will be my temple. besides, a man like you should not carry an ordinary bowl. so please keep this golden one which was made specially for you."Any ordinary fakir would have said that I can not touch it and have renounced the world but nagarjuna was no ordinary mystic, it was all same for him.

I have lived here for so long.\'can darkness give resistance? will it make any difference whether darkness is one day old or millions of years old."Thief understood the point: darkness can not resist light.

She fell so in love that she took the little pebble with her wherever she went, and for months she regaled the young man with gifts and attention. But his heart remained as hard as the stone in her hands. Losing hope, she ended up throwing the pebble into a fire. In the heat of the fire, the sand crumbled from around it, and from out of that rough stone a beautiful golden figure emerged. With this, the princess understood that she herself would have to be like the fire, and go about separating what is useless from what is truly important. During the following months she set about changing the kingdom, and devoted her life, her wisdom, and her riches to separating what is truly valuable from what is unimportant. She gave up the luxury, the jewels, the excess; and it meant that everyone in the kingdom now had food to eat and books to read. So many people came away from their interaction with the princess enchanted by her character and her charisma. Her mere presence transmitted such human warmth that they started to call her \'the princess of fire\'. And as with the pebble, the fire of her presence melted the hardness of the young man\'s heart. And just as he had promised, he became so tender and considerate that he made the princess happy till the end of her days.

["Someone was killing the books. Every day a new book was found open in the library with completely blank pages. No one suspected that the murderer was the evil zepo rete who emptied the books at night with a hoover that sucked up all the letters. Then he carried them stealthily to his lair, where he used an incredible word blender to make a magic juice. In truth, zepo rete had always been bad, but he was also stupid and when he realised that books made people smarter he decided to put them in a blender and drink them, thinking that it would make him cleverer. But books aren't for drinking, nor are they for chewing. They need to be read and when zepo rete started to drink his juice made from books, he filled himself with stories and words that needed to be read. And the words, who were very smart, discovered that they would only be read if they travelled through the body and onto the skin of zepo rete, who was transformed into an enormous tattoo filled with thousands of letters. He used hundreds of soaps and bleaches to try and wash off the words before he realised that the only way to remove them was by reading them. So, even though he didn't want to read a single word, he had little choice and he read his own skin for weeks on end to get rid of all the books he had killed. So, was that the end to the mystery of the book murderer? Far from it! Every morning, even today, a new book is found empty in the library and no one knows why. Have you figured it out? Yes, it is still zepo rete, who continues to hoover up the letters and drink the juice because he discovered that he loved nothing more than reading the books on his skin. Given that he did indeed become smarter, he still empties books every night without getting caught.

["There are many legends dealing with the extinction of dragons, but only one of them involves a certain sir emile, a brave knight who finished off the last thousand dragons. Like many others, sir emile spent years studying the cruel and wicked behaviour of the dragons of his time. However, his own particular conclusions were unique and unusual: dragons lived in a constant state of anger, which created the fire that came from their mouths.

Taking advantage of the dragon having calmed down for a moment, sir emile offered it a piece of fruit, and to the dragon this tasted heavenly. Dragons didn't normally eat fruit or vegetables, because the fire of their mouths burned such food and left it without any taste.

['Once upon a time there was a paper doll that had no face. His whole body was perfectly cut out and painted, except for his face. However, he had a pencil in his hand so could choose whatever face he wanted to have. How lucky! He then spent all day asking everyone he met:"What\'s a perfect face like?""One with a big beak" Answered the birds. "No. not one with a beak" Said the trees. "The perfect face is full of leaves". "Forget the beak and the leaves" Interrupted the flowers. "If you want a perfect face you fill it with colours".

['Once upon a time there was a little prince who was used to having everything he wanted. He was so spoilt that he wouldn\'t let anybody have a new toy if he didn\'t have it first. So, if any child in the land wanted a new toy, they had to buy two and give one to the prince. One day a mysterious toymaker, who invented the most wonderful toys, came to the land. The prince liked his toys so much that he invited him to spend an entire year in the castle, promising him great wealth if he made him a new toy every day. The toymaker set just one condition:"My toys are very special and need an owner who will play with them" He said. "Will you be able to devote a little time to each one every day?""Of course, I will" The little prince replied impatiently. "I\'d love to."From then on, every morning the prince received a new toy. Every day it seemed that there could never be a better toy and every day the toymaker delivered a toy better than the previous ones. The prince appeared very happy. But the toy collection kept growing and, after a few weeks had passed, there were simply too many toys to play with all of them every day. So, one day the prince put a few toys to one side, hoping that the toymaker wouldn\'t notice. However, when it was night time and the prince was ready to go to bed the toys that had been put away lined up in front of him and, one by one, demanded their daily playtime. The little prince couldn\'t get to sleep until well past midnight because he had to play with every single toy. Next day, tired after all his efforts, the prince slept very late. In the little time left of the day, he had to get to know a new toy and then play with all the others too. Once again, he finished very late and was so tired he could hardly stop yawning.

He was constantly changing toys, just like a terrible nightmare. Until one day, as he was looking out of his window, he saw some children playing with a stone next to the castle. "Hmmmm, I have an idea!" He said, and he sent for the children. They turned up gloomly, wondering whether he would force them to hand over their stone, just as he had done many times before with other toys. But the prince didn\'t want the stone. Surprisingly, he only wanted them to play with him and share his toys. When they\'d finished playing the prince let them take home the toys they liked the most. The idea had worked.

['There was once a town where the thing everyone feared the most was getting lost at night in the "Cave of fear". No one had ever returned from there, and whenever anyone got lost and ended up there, the last that was heard was a great cry of terror, followed by a few enormous guffaws. The townsfolk lived in terror that one day the monster would leave the cave. So they regularly left gifts and food at the mouth of the cave, and these always soon disappeared. One day, a young man came to town, and, as he heard about the situation with the cave, he thought that it was unfair. So he decided to enter the cave and confront the monster. The young man asked for some help, but everyone was so afraid that not a single person approached the mouth of the cave with him. He went inside, finding his way with a torch, and calling out to the monster, wanting to talk with it and discuss the situation. At first, the monster had a good long laugh, and the young man followed the sound of the monster\'s voice. But then the monster went quiet, and the young man had to carry on, not knowing in which direction to go. Finally he arrived at a huge cavern.

This pushed him forward towards a hole in the rock. He couldn\'t avoid it, and fell through. Believing that he was about to die, he let out one last cry.

That mayor had tried to accomplish great things, but was always held back by the fears of the people around him. So the mayor invented the story of the monster to demonstrate to people how such an attitude was so limiting.

['That weekend miss ellis handed out another of her famous experiment assignments. Her pupils loved that form of teaching, in which they themselves had to think up experiments that would aid in understanding. Many had to do with science, chemistry, but others - the most famous experiments - had to do with people and their behaviour. And on that occasion the subject was really difficult: freedom. How can one conduct an experiment on freedom? What could you show about freedom through experiments? On their way home, the students discussed these, and other similar questions. However, they had already done a good job on other experiments, and this time was no exception. On monday, the students returned with their ideas for an experiment, and they explained them one by one. All the ideas were very interesting but, to cut a long story short, miss ellis has asked me to tell you only about amanda, charlie, and andrea\'s experiments - which she liked the most. Amanda took out five different coloured boxes and gave them to the teacher to choose one. Miss ellis gratefully took the pink box, and smiled. Then amanda took out five yellow boxes, and asked charlie to choose one. Charlie, annoyed, carelessly chose one. Miss ellis, amused, asked amanda what the experiment was called. "I\'ve called it \'choices\'." For freedom to exist you have to choose between different options. That\'s why charlie was a bit annoyed, because when the boxes are all the same colour, you are not really allowed to choose. But miss ellis has been pleased because she got to choose the box she liked the most".charlie had prepared another kind of experiment, a more lively one. he chose two class members. lucas was a bright but indecisive boy, and paul was one of the worst students. charlie made them go up to join miss ellis at the blackboard. then he divided the class into three groups.to the first group he said: "I\'m going to ask you a difficult question. You can choose one of the three people at the blackboard to help you answer it. Whoever gets the answer right will win a big bag of sweets". everyone in the first group chose the teacher.then charlie said to the second group: "You will be asked the same question, but before we start you should know that I have given paul a piece of paper with the question and its answer written on it". amid the sound of complaints from the first group, the second group all chose paul.then charlie spoke to the last group: "It\'s your turn. What I told the second group was a lie. I gave the paper to lucas". amid booing and a few laughs, paul showed that his hands were empty, and lucas showed everyone that he did indeed have a piece of paper with the question and answer on it. and lucas was the only one who managed to answer the difficult question correctly.while the winners were sharing the sweets out to everyone, charlie explained: "This experiment is called \'no freedom without truth\' "It shows that you can only choose freely if you know the whole truth of the situation. groups one and two were free to choose who they wanted, but as they didn\'t know the full truth of the set-up, they were not really choosing freely. if they had known, then they would have chosen differently.andrea\'s experiment was very different. she had come to class with laylow, her hamster, and some pieces of cheese and bread, to prepare a few different tests. in the first she covered a piece of cheese with a glass. and at its side she placed a piece of bread, without covering it. when she set laylow free, the hamster went straight for the cheese, banging his nose against the glass. laylow tried to get to the cheese for a good old while, but having no success he settled for the bread. andrea carried on with some similar experiments, a little cruel, but amusing, in which poor laylow could never get to the cheese and had to choose the bread. finally, andrea put a lump of cheese and a lump of bread on the table, both uncovered. this time, laylow, bored, went straight over and ate the bread.everyone enjoyed the experiment, and while miss ellis rewarded laylow with the cheese, andrea explained: "The experiment is called \'limits\'. It shows that, whether we know it or not, our freedom always has limits, and that these limits are not always outside ourselves. They can be inside us too, as with laylow, who thought he would never be able to get the cheese. Many more interesting experiments were performed that day, and maybe sometime we\'ll get to talk about them, but what is clear is that miss ellis\'s students ended up knowing a lot more about freedom than do many much older people.

["Amanda was really excited. They had waited many days, but finally, that night, the baby turtles would hatch out on the beach. And her daddy was going to take her to see them! So, amanda and her father got up when it was still dark, took their torches, and carefully made their way to the beach. Her father made her promise to respect the baby turtles, not to make any noise, and to do what he told her. Well, amanda was willing to do almost anything if it meant that she could go and see the turtles hatch. She didn't really know what it would be like, but her older brother had told her that the turtles are born on the beach just a few metres from the water's edge. After hatching they quickly scuttle towards the sea. All that sounded very exciting to her. Crouching quietly, by the light of only one of the torches on a low setting, amanda and her daddy waited. She looked all over, hoping to see mother turtle, and she almost missed the appearance of the first baby turtle. It was so tiny! It moved very clumsily, like most babies; and without waiting for either its brothers or sisters or mother, it started to scuttle towards the sea. Gradually, more and more baby turtles appeared, and all ran towards the water. Amanda and her daddy stayed hidden and quiet, watching the wonderful spectacle of that crazy race to the sea. But then something happened which, to amanda, seemed horrible. Some seagulls and other birds arrived, and they started eating some of the little turtles. She kept looking everywhere to see whether daddy turtle would turn up to give those birds a good hiding. But he never came. Amanda was watching all this with tears in her eyes, and when the first group of baby turtles finally reached the water and were safe from the birds, she gave out a little cry of happiness. Even with the birds eating quite a few little turtles, in the end many more reached the sea, and amanda was very pleased that they had managed to do so. On their way home, her father, who had noticed the tears in amanda's eyes, explained to her that turtles were born that way. Mother turtle lays many eggs, hides them in the sand, and off she goes. When the baby turtles hatch out, they have to try to reach the sea on their own. That's why so many are born, because lots of them get eaten by other animals, and not only on the sand, also in the water. He explained to her that the few turtles who manage to become adults live for many, many years. Amanda was really glad to have learned so much about the turtles that night, but as they continued home all she could think of was how happy she was to have a family; happy that her parents and her brothers and sisters had helped her and cared for her so much right from the day she was born.

['The science teacher, mr litmus, had asked his students to study some particular animal. They would write a short report, and tell the rest of the class their conclusions. Some talked about dogs, others about horses, some chose fish. But the most interesting discovery of all was made by little sophie:"I found that flies are terribly grumpy", she said, very sure of herself. Everyone smiled, waiting for her to continue. Then sophie explained: "I spent hours in my house, watching flies. when they flied normally, everything was ok, but when they found a window they would really start buzzing. I had always thought they made that noise with their wings, but they don\'t. with my daddy\'s binoculars I inspected the flies really closely, and saw that what they were really doing was shouting and protesting. they were so hysterical that they couldn\'t fly out the window, and they would just beat their heads against the glass again and again. if only they had watched the butterfly that passed by. they would have seen that the top of the window was open. the butterfly tried to tell them, but it had no effect at all. the flies just kept on shouting and complaining". Mr litmus was amused, and explained to the class that that form of fly behaviour had nothing to do with anger. Instead, it was an example of creatures having different levels of intelligence and awareness. They agreed that the next day they would bring a list of creatures in their order of intelligence…and this was what caused a big rumpus in the science class. Many parents had to come and complain, because their children… had listed their parents as among the least intelligent of creatures! This, said the children, was because the parents did nothing but complain, and they never listened to anyone. And, although mr litmus had to do a lot of explaining, and calm down quite a few parents, it helped some of them realise that, although they weren\'t stupid, they often behaved not terribly intelligently.

A magic sleigh was sent to their homes to collect them, and they flew north, pirouetting through the clouds, as christmas music played. Everything they came across was marvellous, never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined it all, and they excitedly waited to see that loveable red figure who had spent so many years bringing them gifts every christmas. When the moment finally arrived, they entered a great hall and were left alone. The hall was dark and empty: all there was was a large desk right at the back, and a big chair behind it. Some elves came in and said:"Santa claus is very busy. you\'ll only be able to see him for a short while, so make the most of it."Rodd and todd waited a long time, in silence, thinking of what to say. But they forgot everything when the hall began filling with lights and colours. Santa claus appeared on the big chair, and as soon as he did so, the large desk became covered with all the toys the two boys had ever wanted. How exciting! While todd ran to hug santa claus, rodd went over to the bicycle he had always dreamed of having. Santa was only there for a few seconds, just enough for todd to say "Thank you", and for him to feel like the happiest boy in the world, and santa disappeared before rodd had even looked at him.

He cried and complained, demanding that santa come back, but within a few hours the two boys had been returned to their homes.

"Sparky hooves was a fighting bull. his field was next to the farmer\'s house and sparky could see through the farmer\'s window. one day sparky stood next to the house, watching the farmer\'s telly, and they were televising a bullfight. sparky realised that this is what lay ahead of him, and so he spent the rest of his life preparing for that day, the day of his fight. soon that day arrived. when sparky entered the bullring, he was jabbed in the back. it was very painful, and sparky felt like his blood was boiling, screaming for revenge. but he knew exactly what he needed to do, and he remained still. soon the bullfighter appeared, trying to provoke sparky, swishing his cape in the air. sparky felt like sticking his horns deep into this stupid guy, but he swallowed his anger, kept still, and waited. no matter what they did, trying to provoke him with jabs, waved flags, and red capes, sparky kept still. after some time, the crowd started whistling and booing. it got so bad that the bullfight organisers decided to change the bull. this had been the most boring bull anyone could remember. so sparky hooves was returned to his field, and allowed to live out his life in peace. never again did they put him in a bullring, because everyone knew that he would provide no amusement". "Yeah, but what does this have to do with me?", asked rocky. "Well, everything, my friend. they took sparky to a bullring because they wanted to have fun at his expense. the more he would have responded to the provocation, the more they would have enjoyed themselves, and they wouldn\'t have stopped until the thing was finished. the same is happening to you when they make fun of you. they enjoy it because they see how angry they make you. but if you did what sparky hooves did, not reacting to anything, they\'d get bored and look for someone else to pick on, someone who provides more amusement". Rocky believed none of it. However, in the next few days, he gradually tried to put this advice into practice. At first it wasn\'t easy, but as rocky kept to his plan, the bullies got bored with him. In a few days they found more interesting things to do than pick on rocky. ', 'The best thing to do with bullies is ignore them. ', 13]

['When I got home that night as my wife served dinner, I held her hand and said, I\'ve got something to tell you. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes. \xa0 suddenly I didn\'t know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly. She didn\'t seem to be annoyed by my words, instead she asked me softly, why? \xa0 I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn\'t talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to jane. I didn\'t love her anymore. I just pitied her! With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company. \xa0 she glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved jane so dearly. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn\'t have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with jane. \xa0 when I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again. In the morning she presented her divorce conditions. \xa0 she didn\'t want anything from me, but needed a month\'s notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month, we both try to live as normal a life as possible. Her reason for this conditions were simple. \xa0 our son had his exams in a month\'s time and she didn\'t want to disrupt him with our broken marriage. This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into out bridal room on our wedding day. \xa0 she requested that every day for the month\'s duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request. I told jane about my wife\'s divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully. My wife and I hadn\'t had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don\'t tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn\'t looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young any more. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her. On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me. On the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn\'t tell jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily. \xa0 suddenly it hit me. She had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. Our son came in at the moment and said, dad, it\'s time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last-minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly, it was just like our wedding day. But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn\'t noticed that our life lacked intimacy. \xa0 I drove to office and jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind. \xa0 I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, sorry, jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, jane, I said, I won\'t divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn\'t value the details of our lives, not because we didn\'t love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away. \xa0 at the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The sales girl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, "I\'ll carry you out every morning until death do us apart". That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run up stairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting cancer for months and I was so busy with jane to even notice.

['A shepherd boy tended his master\'s sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd\'s pipe. One day as he sat watching the sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His master had told him to call for help should a wolf attack the flock, and the villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! wolf!"As he expected, the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the shepherd boy again shouted, "Wolf! wolf!" Again the villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the sheep. In terror the boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! wolf!" But though the villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," They said. The wolf killed a great many of the boy\'s sheep and then slipped away into the forest. ', 'If you keep lying, no one will believe you even if you are speaking the truth. Always speak the truth.

['Once upon a time, a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didn\'t know how she was going to make it. She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed. Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot. He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing. After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her, he asked. "Daughter, what do you see?" "Potatoes, eggs and coffee," She hastily replied. "Look closer", he said, "And touch the potatoes." She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face. "Father, what does this mean?" She asked. He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity-the boiling water. However, each one reacted differently. The potato went in strong, hard and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak. The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard. However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new. "Which one are you?" He asked his daughter.

['There was once a little village separated from the sea and its great cliffs by a forest. That forest was the village\'s best defence against the storms and furies of the sea, that were so ferocious throughout the region that it was only possible to live where the village was. Yet the forest was constantly in danger, because a small group of wicked beings came every night to cut down some of the trees. The villagers could do nothing to stop the felling, so they were forced to constantly plant new trees to replace the fallen ones. And for generations, such was life for the tree planters. Parents taught their children how to plant, and the children, from a very early age, spent all their free time planting new trees. Each family was responsible for replanting a particular area, and had been since time immemorial. Failure of any family to do this would have brought the community to ruin. Of course, most of the planted trees were lost due to a thousand varying reasons, and only a small percentage reached full growth. But so many were planted that the protective forest managed to maintain its size, despite the great storms and the cruel felling of the evil beings. But then, there was a great misfortune. One of the families died out due to lack of descendents, and their area of the forest began losing more trees. There was nothing to be done, the tragedy was inevitable, and in the village the people prepared to emigrate after so many centuries. Even so, one of the young men refused to abandon the village. -"I won\'t go," He said, -"If needed, I will start a new family that will look after that area, and I myself will go to work on it from day one."Everyone knew that no one was capable of looking after a replanting area all on their own and, as the forest would take some time to thin out, they accepted the young man\'s proposal. Yet, by doing so, they had accepted the greatest revolution ever seen in the village. That young man, loved by all, had no trouble in finding people to help him replant. But those helping hands all came from other areas, and soon his own area wasn\'t the only one in need of extra help and more trees. These new areas were helped by other families and soon no one knew whether they should look after their own area or someone else\'s: so to simplify things they just planted trees wherever they were needed. But they were needed in so many areas that the villagers began planting even during the night, despite their ancestral fear of the wicked tree cutters. Those nocturnal plantings meant the planters came across some of the fellers, only to discover that those "Wicked" Beings were nothing more than the frightened members of a tribe that hid themselves in the labyrinthine cliff caves during the day. They would surface at night to get some wood and food, so they could survive. As soon as these "Beings" Got to see how good it was living in a village on the surface, having food and water, and knowing how to plant trees, they begged to be accepted into the village. With each new night, the village gained more hands to help with the planting, and there were fewer cave-dwellers cutting down the trees. Soon, the village filled with grateful "Night-beings" Who mixed happily among the old families until they became indistinguishable. And so great was their influence, that the forest began to expand. Day after day, year after year, almost imperceptibly, the forest got bigger and bigger, and it provided more and more protection, until finally the descendants from that village could live anywhere they liked in the region. And they never would have known that, a long time ago, they had their origin in a village protected by a few trees that were on the point of disappearing.

One day, he met a famous doctor who thought the boy's case was so peculiar that he decided to investigate him. So, with a complex system of cameras and tubes, the doctor managed to record what was happening inside the boy. What he discovered was surprising. Each time the boy did something good, a thousand tiny angels gathered around the boy's heart and started tickling it. That explained the boy's happiness, but the doctor continued studying until he discovered that we all have our own thousand angels inside us. Unfortunately, he found that, as we do so few good things, the angels spend most of their time wandering about, bored. And so it was that the secret to happiness was discovered. Thanks to that little boy we now know exactly what we have to do to feel our hearts being tickled. ", 'Happiness and contentment come from good deeds. ', 13]

I cannot take money from you for this."King again said, "No, if you ask right, we will definitely pay you for this work."Tailor thought, "King already had button and I only used my thread, so I should ask for 2 rupees for this work but then again what if I ask 2 rupees from king and think that tailor is asking so much for such little work, what if king thinks that if I am asking this much money from king then how much he must be demanding from locals."Thinking all this, at last tailor said, "Maharaj, you give me whatever you think is right."Now, king had to give according to his reputation, thinking this, king asked minister to give two villages to tailor as payment for his work.

She didn\'t seem to be annoyed by my words, instead, she asked me softly, why? \xa0I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn\'t talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to jane. I didn\'t love her anymore. I just pitied her! With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake in my company. \xa0she glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved jane so dearly. Finally, she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me, her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn\'t have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with jane. \xa0when I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again. In the morning she presented her divorce conditions. \xa0she didn\'t want anything from me but needed a month\'s notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month, we both try to live as normal a life as possible. Her reason for this conditions was simple. \xa0our son had his exams in a month\'s time and she didn\'t want to disrupt him with our broken marriage. This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into out bridal room on our wedding day. \xa0she requested that everyday for the month\'s duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request. I told jane about my wife\'s divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully. My wife and I hadn\'t had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don\'t tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn\'t looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young anymore. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her. On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me. \xa0on the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn\'t tell jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily. \xa0suddenly it hit me. She had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. Our son came in at the moment and said, dad, it\'s time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last-minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly, it was just like our wedding day. But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn\'t noticed that our life lacked intimacy. \xa0I drove to the office and jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind. \xa0I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, sorry, jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, jane, I said, I won\'t divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn\'t value the details of our lives, not because we didn\'t love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death does us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away. \xa0at the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, "I\'ll carry you out every morning until death does us apart". That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run upstairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting cancer for months and I was so busy with jane to even notice.

That was chuckles\' favourite trick to play on grumpy little kids. Gus wasn\'t at all impressed by this new development; it just made him complain even more. He was even angrier after he realised that the cloud was following him. Well, this carried on for almost a week. Gus couldn\'t get away from the cloud, and he got more and more infuriated. Gus had a little friend, a happy and generous girl called gladys. Gladys was the only one who had been willing to hang around with gus during all those black, rainy days. All the other children had run off to avoid getting soaked and ending up completely black. One day, when gus was at the end of his tether, she said to him: "Cheer up! what you should realise is that you\'re the only one of us who has his very own cloud, and even better, its rain is black! we could play some fun games with a cloud like this, don\'t you reckon?" As gladys was his only company these days, and he didn\'t want her to leave as the others had, gus reluctantly agreed. Gladys took him to the swimming pool, and left him there until all the pool water was black. Then she went and got other kids. They came and played in the pool. The water being black meant they could play hide and seek! Grudgingly, gus had to admit it had been a lot of fun, but what was even more fun was playing wet the cat. Gus would find cats and run alongside them. When the cats felt themselves getting wet they would jump about in the craziest way, and run off at top speed, with funny looks on their faces. Before long, all the children in town had gathered around gus, thinking up new games they could play using the cloud. For the first time ever, gus started to see the positive side of things; even things which, at first, had seemed so bad. Chuckles, the prankster cloud, thought that he could now leave; his work had been done. But, before leaving, he gave gus two days of multicoloured rain, with which the children invented the most fun games ever. When chuckles finally left, gus didn\'t complain. Now he knew to focus on the good in life, and the good thing about chuckles\' departure was that no longer was gus soaking wet all day. Now he could go and do dry things, and that\'s exactly what he did. ', 'Everything has its good and bad side. We are happiest when we look for the good in all things. ', 13]
['Perry piccolo was a rich kid who led a very nice, comfortable life, protected from most of the bad stuff in the world. One day, perry went to the movies to see a film he\'d been dying to see. The problem was that he arrived a bit late, just as the last ticket was being sold to a very poor looking boy. The boy had been saving for weeks to buy this ticket. Realising there was no ticket left for himself, perry was furious, and started shouting and protesting, demanding that the boy hand his over. "But why should I give you my ticket? I arrived before you did and I\'ve paid for it", said the boy. "Because I\'m more important than you! look at me! I\'m rich and you are poor. don\'t you see?", perry replied. At that moment, a very distinguished looking man came over to perry and offered him a ticket, saying,"Of course, my boy. you have more of a right than him to see this movie". Then perry, in the most showy and superior way, walked off from the boy and entered the cinema. When he got inside the auditorium, perry looked around and was pleased to see that the place was filled with other rich children like himself. He made his way to a seat. However, as soon as perry sat down, he vanished and was somehow teleported onto the cinema screen. He realised he had turned into a movie character, playing the central role in many stories. And in all those stories perry started out with a lot of bad luck: a couple of times his parents disappeared, other times his house burned down and he lost all his money. In some stories he had to travel to countries where he didn\'t understand the language, in others he had to work straight from childhood, to help support all his brothers and sisters. Sometimes he found himself in a situation where everyone treated him like a fool, or like someone who had no feelings…in all these stories, perry had to struggle terribly to survive and overcome his difficulties. He managed this, even though few people would have given him a hope. All the stories had a happy ending, in which a wise, fortunate, rich, and mysterious character would help perry to fulfil his dreams. When all this came to an end, perry found himself back in his seat, feeling pretty shocked. He realised that in real life he had always been fortunate, and had never helped anyone to have a happy ending of their own. He felt terrible, and spent a long time in that seat, crying. Finally, an enormous smile broke over his face, and he left the cinema, almost dancing. He was happy because now he knew what he was going to do with his life. He was going to be that helpful person who comes to the aid of less fortunate people. He would be a maker of happy endings! On his way home, over in the distance he saw the distinguished looking man who had given him the movie ticket. And perry realised that that man was the same one who had appeared at the end of all the stories on the cinema screen. The man who created happy endings.

['Once upon a time there was a wise king who worriedly observed the great importance everyone gave to money. This despite the fact that in his country there were no poor people and everyone lived quite well. -"Why so much insistence on making money?" He asked his advisors, -"How does it really help them?" -"It seems they use it to buy bits and pieces which bring them a little happiness," Answered the advisors, after much investigation. -"Happiness is what they\'re pursuing with their money?" And after thinking for a moment, the king smiled and added, -"In that case I have the solution: we\'ll change the currency."And so he went to see the kingdom\'s wizards and inventors to assign them the task of creating a new device: the smileofax. Before long, everyone in the land had been issued a smileofax containing over a hundred smiles, and in return the people had to hand in all their money. -"Why use money if what we really want is happiness?" Said the king, solemnly, on the day of the exchange. -"From this day forward we will carry our happiness with us everywhere, in our pockets, thanks to the smileofax!"It was a revolutionary decision. Anyone could pull a smile from the smileofax, put it on their face and be joyful for quite a while. However, several days later, the less thrifty types had used up all their smiles, and they knew of no way they could get any more. The problem spread so much that people started complaining and protesting against the king\'s decision, demanding that they return to the money system. But the king assured them they wouldn\'t be going back to money, and they should learn how to acquire smiles just as they had previously acquired money. And so work began on the smile economy. First they tried selling things in exchange for smiles, only to discover that the smiles of others were no good to themselves. Then it was thought that exchanging smileofaxes could sort out the problem, but that didn\'t work either. Many people gave up working and tried all kinds of crazy stuff. Finally, after many vain attempts, and almost by chance, an old farmer discovered how the smile economy would work. That farmer had had a stupendous harvest which he believed would make him rich, but his harvest came in just when the king had gotten rid of money, so the farmer could do nothing with all his exquisite food. He too had tried using it to acquire smiles, but finally, seeing that this wasn\'t working, he decided to go from street to street sharing the food with his neighbours. Though it cost him dear to give away his whole harvest, the farmer felt wonderful after having done so. Yet he couldn\'t have dreamed what was waiting for him when he returned home empty-handed. Discarded on the floor, next to the door, he found his forgotten smileofax, and it was completely full of new, fresh smiles! And so it was that the country discovered the true economy of happiness, having understood that it can\'t be bought with money, but rather with the good works of each person - the only way to fill up a smileofax. And they put this understanding into such good practice that up to this very day they won\'t hear anything about money, seeing it as nothing but an obstacle to true happiness. ', 'We often accumulate money to acquire things to make us feel better, but sharing time and money with others brings us more happiness. ', 13]

He called out kidnappers and said, "I can make you rich beyond your wildest dream. for I am great and powerful. you must trust me and untie me. treat me properly, let me wash my head and face and dress me in new clothes. then after honoring me properly, leave me alone to do my magic."Kidnappers wanted money so they agreed and did as said.

Then they attacked kidnapper gang for jewels and killed them all. After getting jewels robbers started to fight between them and in bloody battle all died.

So, shewent to the horse, and asked him to carry her away from the houndson his back. But he declined, stating that he had important workto do for his master. "He felt sure," He said, "That all herother friends would come to her assistance." She then applied1 tothe bull, and hoped that he would repel2 the hounds with his horns. The bull replied: "I am very sorry, but I have an appointment witha lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what youwant." The goat, however, feared that his back might do her someharm if he took her upon it. The ram3, he felt sure, was theproper friend to apply to. So she went to the ram and told himthe case. The ram replied: "Another time, my dear friend. I donot like to interfere4 on the present occasion, as hounds have beenknown to eat sheep as well as hares." The hare then applied, as alast hope, to the calf5, who regretted that he was unable to helpher, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself,as so many older persons than himself had declined the task. Bythis time the hounds were quite near, and the hare took to herheels and luckily escaped. ', 'He that has many friends, has no friends. ', 14]

"Pardon, o king," Cried the little mouse: "Forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?"The lion was so tickled at the idea of the mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go. Some time after the lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the king, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on. Just then the little mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the king of the beasts. "Was I not right?"

['Once upon a time there was a little boy who became very ill. He had to spend all day in bed, unable to move. Because other children weren\'t allowed to come near him, he suffered greatly, and spent his days feeling sad and blue. There wasn\'t much he could do except look out of the window. Time passed, and his feeling of despair just grew. Until one day he saw a strange shape in the window. It was a penguin eating a sausage sandwich. The penguin squeezed in through the open window, said "Good afternoon" To the boy, turned around, and left again. Of course, the boy was very surprised. He was still trying to work out what had happened, when outside his window he saw a monkey in a nappy, busy blowing up a balloon. At first the boy asked himself what that could possibly be, but after a while, as more and more crazy-looking characters appeared out the window, he burst out laughing and found it hard to stop. Anyone wanting to stop laughing would never be helped by seeing a pig playing a tambourine, an elephant jumping on a trampoline, or a dog wearing a pair of glasses and talking about nothing except politics. The little boy didn\'t tell anyone about this because who would have believed him? Even so, those strange characters ended up putting joy back in his heart, and in his body. Before long, his health had improved so much that he was able to go back to school again. There he got to talk to his friends, and tell them all the strange things he had seen. While he was talking to his best friend he saw something sticking out of his friend\'s school bag. The boy asked his friend what it was, and he was so insistent that finally his friend had to show him what was in the bag: there, inside, were all the fancy-dress suits and disguises that his best friend had been using to try to cheer the little boy up! And from that day on, the little boy always did his best to make sure that no one felt sad and alone. ', 'Friends are for cheering you up in your worst moments. ', 14]
['Once upon a time, while flying through the air, a stork noticed the sparkle of a ring. It belonged to a rabbit who was getting married that day. The rabbit went inside its burrow leaving the ring outside, and the stork decided to try it on quickly without asking. However, when she tried to take the ring off again, it got stuck on her finger and she thought:"Oh no! they\'re going to catch me. I\'ll have to think of something!"Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had seen her, she flew off thinking she could return the ring when she eventually got it off her finger. The rabbit was very annoyed to find that the ring had been stolen. But he was a good detective and very quickly everyone in the forest was looking for a bird with a ring. When the stork found out, she thought to herself:"How embarrassing! they\'re going to catch me. I\'ll have to think of something!"And she quickly decided to hide the ring by dipping her feet in a bucket of black paint that she found near to where they were setting up the wedding. However, as she flew away lots of the paint dripped off onto the tablecloths and onto the bride\'s dress, ruining them! When the rabbit arrived and saw the disaster, he was furious. Forgetting about the ring, he sent everybody off to look for a bird with feet painted black. When the stork found out, she thought to herself:"How embarrassing! they\'re going to catch me. I\'ll have to think of something!"And so she decided to bandage her feet and pretend that she\'d had an accident. The stork thought that she had solved the problem, but shortly after she bumped into the rabbit himself who, seeing the stork was hurt felt sorry for her and insisted on taking her to the hospital for an x-ray. The stork just couldn\'t say no. But she knew that if they did an x-ray they would find the ring and if they took off the bandage they would see the paint, so she said to herself:"How embarrassing! they\'re going to catch me. I\'ll have to think of something!"Given that her house was on the way to the hospital, she asked the rabbit to wait for a moment while she went to fetch a few things. Once inside her house, the stork took off the bandages and wrapped her feet in lead plates so the ring would not show up in the x-ray. She then put the bandages back on with loads of glue, making it impossible to take them off. The stork thought that by doing this she could go to the doctor without being found out and, later on, would find a way to return the ring to the rabbit. Feeling more relaxed, the stork flew off to meet up with the rabbit, not realising that she wouldn\'t be able to fly with so much weight attached to her feet. As soon as she left her nest, she began to fall like a heavy stone and could do nothing to stop herself from crashing to the ground. However, she didn\'t land on the ground. Instead, she landed on the poor rabbit, who had no time to get out of the way. Ambulances, police, doctors and hundreds of animals rushed to the scene and asked the stork how she had come to fall on the rabbit. When they found the bandages, the lead, the paint and the ring, they all thought the fall was the final part of the storks\' cruel plan to ruin the rabbit\'s wedding. In one single morning, the stork had become the most hated animal in the whole forest and lost all her friends. Only after a long time did the rabbit dare visit the stork and he still couldn\'t understand why she had insisted on ruining his wedding. Full of remorse, the stork begged the rabbit for forgiveness and told him the story of the ring and everything that had happened afterwards. "I would never have imagined that all this could happen just because you tried the ring on without permission", said the rabbit laughing. "It wasn\'t even because of that" The embarrassed stork replied. "It was everything I had to do to hide the ring over and over again. you wouldn\'t have been as annoyed if you had found me trying it on and had to help me take it off."Seeing that the stork had learned her lesson, the rabbit publicly forgave her so she could get her friends back and tell her story, which helped everyone understand that the truly worst thing about telling little lies are the bigger lies that have to be invented to cover them up.

['There was once a merchant who, after years of bad business, was cursing his bad luck. A traveller was passing by, and he asked the merchant what was troubling him. Hearing that the merchant was a man of great ill fortune, the traveller opened his knapsack and pulled out a strange-looking device made from two crystal glasses stuck together. They were decorated with strange drawings. One glass was green, and the other red, and inside each glass were some strange seeds, each the same colour as their glass. "Well, you\'ve just run into some good luck, meeting me," Said the traveller. "This is exactly what you need: two little pots of luck."The merchant was somewhat surprised, but the traveller explained to him that these seeds were seeds of luck. The green seeds brought good luck, and the red seeds brought bad luck. The two glasses were joined, and when one filled up, it caused multiple incidents of good or bad luck, according to which type of seed was overflowing the glass. The merchant, thrilled, thanked him for the gift, and hardly managed to hear the traveller\'s last words, warning the merchant how difficult it was to use the glasses effectively. Expectantly, he carefully examined the green seeds; the lucky ones. Though he wasn\'t familiar with them, he was sure he could find someone that could sell him several new containers, and so he covered the top of the vessel with great care, being sure not to drop it. Then he looked at the red seeds, and thought that the best way to avoid them filling the glass would be to empty them out, right there. So that\'s what he did, and off he went, continuing his journey. A little later, he met a woman who, seeing his seed jars, must have recognised them. She ran up to him and asked him for a good handful of seeds. The merchant roundly refused, and the woman left, cursing him under her breath. "What do they want me to do?" He thought, sadly, "I can\'t just throw away my good luck." He continued on his way, and had many other similar encounters. As time went on, the merchant saw that only the red jar was filling up. It seemed more or less logical, because otherwise the jars wouldn\'t have much power. He just stopped every now and then to empty the red seeds out. However, the red jar was filling up faster and faster, and it reached a point where he could hardly empty it before it had filled up again. Finally it started overflowing. "Well, that\'s gone and done it," Thought the merchant, "All I need now is another pile of bad luck." He looked all the way back down the road, and saw that the seeds he had emptied out, had grown into great big weeds which had choked to death all the other plants in the area. When the local villagers saw this, they were furious, and set about finding who had caused the destruction of their crops. The merchant almost escaped suspicion, but the woman who he had refused to give seeds to betrayed him, and he had to run from that village through a hail of kicks and punches. And that was only the start of the series of ill fortune the merchant had to suffer. Without doubt, those seeds were extremely powerful, and all that power had backfired against him. In just three days he tried a hundred times to get rid of those jars, but it would never stop his run of bad luck. Instead, he had to find some way to fill up the green jar, and not spill any more red seeds. So he removed the lid of the green jar, to find, to his horror, that most of the green seeds had disappeared… while he was lamenting his poor luck, he took a moment to examine the pictures on the jars. They seemed to be instructions. In the pictures the red jar was always closed, and the green one always open. It seemed that anyone could take as many green seeds as they liked. He decided to continue his journey in that manner. Soon he met a man who asked him for some seeds, and the merchant told the man to help himself. Immediately after this his luck began to change. The villagers, who had been chasing the merchant weren\'t far off now, but his new friend - who he had given the seeds to - came to the rescue by pointing them in the wrong direction. Similar things occurred with many others he met on the road. The merchant realised that if, instead of throwing them away, he gave the seeds as a gift to others, then the green jar was the one that would fill up. After offering the seeds to everyone, the green jar would begin to overflow. Of course, good luck stayed with him, and wonderful things started happening. One man he helped became a very rich man, and this rich man thanked the merchant in the form of luxuries and expensive gifts. Other people considered the merchant to be such a good man that they put him forward to be mayor. Some time later, the merchant bumped into the traveller who had given him the jars. After greeting him, the merchant told him of his adventures, and he thanked him profusely. But before taking his leave, he asked the traveller: "Why did you give me the lucky jars? did you no longer want to have so much good luck?"And the traveller, laughing loudly, answered: "Don\'t tell me you still have them! those seeds don\'t really do anything!… the \'magic\' of the jars is pure foolishness: all they do is make some stupid seeds increase or decrease in number. some of them are edible, some of them poisonous, but they have no effect at all on luck. I heard they were invented by a wizard\'s stupid, clumsy, apprentice.""You what?!" Exclaimed the merchant, shocked. "I think it was an old teacher who found them and realised they would be a good way to teach people about how best to use your luck. in effect, keep the bad for yourself, and share the good with others. and, in truth, that is the only way to attract the good luck and avoid the bad, and boy, does it work! when you shared out your bad luck, and tried to keep the good luck to yourself, you were sure that no one would want to share the good with you, only the bad. the seeds had nothing to do with all this. everything that happened to you was your own work. do you see now?"And the merchant certainly did understand now! And as the traveller walked off into the distance, with the little jars in his hand, he searched the faces of the townsfolk, looking for who, among them, most needed to learn how best to use their luck. ', 'The best way to have good luck is to share all the good things you have. Grateful friends are the foundation of your good fortune. ', 14]
['Camilla chomp was a very greedy, gluttonous little girl. She hardly had any friends because she thought it was much more fun to spend her time alone, eating cake and pudding. Her parents were worried, so they took all the sweet food in the house and hid it. So camilla left the house, desperately looking for something sweet to eat. On she went, until she ended up in a small abandoned hut full of old pots and glasses of all shapes and sizes. Out of all of them, the one that most caught camilla\'s attention was a shiny little bottle made of gold-coloured glass. It seemed to be full of chocolate, and camilla took a quick swig. It was delicious, but she felt a strange tickling sensation, so she read the label. "Glass tears", it said, and in small print it explained: "Magically converts tears into chocolate."Wow, was camilla excited!

['There was once a teacher who gave his pupils some seeds so they could plant, and look after, their very own sunflower. One boy in the class, who loved sunflower seeds, was so excited that he planted the seed and looked after it with great care for many days. When the first shoot finally appeared, the boy, filled with impatience, went to see his teacher. -"Can I uproot it yet?" He asked, anxiously. The teacher answered that he would still have to tend the plant for quite some time before he would be able to collect many seeds from just one sunflower. The boy was disappointed, but he kept on looking after his sunflower. However, he grew increasingly impatient, and did little else but pester his teacher about wanting to take out the plant. Despite the teacher asking him to be patient, as soon as the boy saw the sunflower\'s first seeds, he cut the plant so he could eat them. But the plant was still green, the seeds were not ripe, and of course they couldn\'t be eaten. The boy was devastated: he had put so much effort into caring for the sunflower, but in the end he had squandered it all for a simple lack of patience. And he was even angrier when he saw how enormous his classmates\' sunflowers grew. Ultimately, he resolved not to be so impatient in the future, and to listen to his teacher. Fortunately, he wasn\'t completely out of luck, and his friends were good enough to share their delicious sunflower seeds with him.

['There was once a lion without a roar. The lion had always been this way, he had never been able to roar. But no one on the plains knew this. Since from an early age he realised he could not roar, he had learnt to talk softly with everyone, and to listen to them. He learned to convince others of his point of view without having to raise the volume levels. This won him the affection and trust of all the inhabitants of the plain. But one day the lion spoke to a pig who was so stupid and stubborn, that the lion could not find a way to make the pig be sensible. He felt a strong urge to roar at the pig, but the fact that he could not made the lion feel at some disadvantage. To try to solve this problem, he spent a few months inventing a roaring machine which he could use whenever he might need it. A short while after completing the roaring machine, the stupid and stubborn pig turned up. He annoyed the lion so much that the lion used the machine. It sent out a truly terrifying roar. "Grrrrrrrrrroauuuuuuuurrrr!!!"Not only did this give the pig a terrible fright, it also shocked all the animals on the plain. So much so that for months none of them dared to come out. The lion became sad and lonely, and had plenty of time to realise that he didn\'t need to roar in order get others to pay attention to him. Without knowing it, his lack of a roar had made him good at talking to others and convincing them.

But what intrigued the animals most was the wonderful treasure they could see inside it. The treasure looked so splendid that the lion king himself said that whoever could get it out would be made his successor as king. As soon as he said this, all the animals lost their dislike of the cold and leapt at the block, furiously trying to secure the treasure. Well, everyone except for the weasel, who stood for a while looking at the block, watching the other animals creating a huge commotion, piled on top of each other.

The weasel told them that before leaping at the problem she had taken some time to think and observe. She concluded that the block was too big to break it up with force, and it would take too long for the sun to melt it. Then it occurred to her that she could get to the middle of the block from underneath, by digging a tunnel.

Years passed, and then there was a great drought which evaporated the little drop from the lake where he lived. When he reached the sky, he became part of a small cloud.

['A greek philosopher was walking along one day, thinking about things, when he saw two very tall women towering away in the distance; they were the size of several men placed one on top of another. The philosopher, as wise as he was fearful, ran to hide behind some bushes, intending to listen to their conversation. The huge women came and sat nearby, but before they could start speaking the king\'s youngest son appeared. He was bleeding from one ear and shouted pleadingly towards the women:   -"Justice! I want justice! that villain cut my ear!"He pointed to another boy, his younger brother, who arrived wielding a bloody sword. -"We will be delighted to give you justice, young prince," Replied the two women, -"That\'s why we are the goddesses of justice. just choose which of the two of us you would prefer to help you." -"What\'s the difference?" The victim asked, -"What would each of you do?" -"I," Said one of the goddesses, who looked the more weak and delicate, -"Will ask your brother what was the cause of his action, and I will listen to his explanation. then I will oblige him to protect your other ear with his life, and to make you the most beautiful helmet to cover your scar and to be your ears when you need it." -" I, for my part," Said the other goddess    -"Will not let him go unpunished for his action. I will punish him with a hundred lashes and one year of imprisonment, and he must compensate you for your pain with a thousand gold coins. and I will give you the sword and you can choose if you\'re able to keep the ear or, on the contrary, you want both ears to end up on the ground. well, what is your decision? who do you want to apply justice for the offence?"The prince looked at the two goddesses. Then he put his hand to the wound, and on touching it his face gave a gesture of undeniable pain, which ended with a look of anger and affection for his brother. And in a firm voice, addressing the second of the goddesses he gave his answer. -"I\'d rather it was you who helps me. I love him, but it would be unfair if my brother doesn\'t receive his punishment."And so, from his hiding place in the bushes, the philosopher saw the culprit get his comeuppance, and watched how the older brother was content to make a small wound on his brother\'s ear, without seriously damaging it.

And that\'s how, from the very hand of the goddess of justice, the philosopher learned that true justice lies in improving the future, moving it away from past wrongs, while false justice and vengeance is incapable of forgiving and forgetting past wrongs, and doing so fixes the future, it always ending up being just as bad.

['Simon was a small plastic figurine who could be placed in any corner whatsoever of the christmas nativity scene. He was born in a huge factory in china and wasn\'t very well painted, which is why he invariably ended up a long way from the stable, filling just any old space or being nibbled by the children of the house. Nonetheless, he loved the baby jesus, who looked and smiled at him every day from his crib. His only dream was that one year they would put him near the crib…one night before christmas, mary gathered everyone together. "We need your help. a big war is about to begin, and baby jesus has had to go away to try and avert it. somebody has to stand in for him until he returns." "I\'ll do it", said a lovely little angel. "I don\'t think it will be too hard to play the role of a baby." That little angel took up its place in the manger and another one had to take its place in the empty spot left. This other angel was replaced by a little shepherd… in short, many of the figurines had to switch places. As a result of the changes, simon ended up as a shepherd, much closer to the manger than ever before. Things did not work out. The angel was lovely and did cry like a baby, but it was obvious that it wasn\'t baby jesus. Joseph had to ask it to leave and they looked for someone else. Once again the figurines switched places and simon ended up closer still to the manger. The new baby did not play the role of baby jesus properly and neither did the many others who were tried throughout the night. Thanks to all the changes, simon had been moved very close to the manger. He was very excited and helped out with everything he could: brushing the animals, cleaning the stable, fetching water, chatting with the elders, singing with the angels… he did such a good job that when they finally found a good replacement, mary and joseph let him stay there, close by. He was the happiest figurine in the whole world, but there was one thing on his mind: when they had chosen the latest replacement, he had been out fetching water and had not seen who it was. Every time he looked, the baby was covered by sheets and, given that nobody seemed to miss the real baby, simon secretly hoped it was jesus who had returned. One day he could wait no longer and, since it was early and everybody was asleep, he took a peek under the sheets…as he lifted his head out from underneath, a giant tear rolled down his cheek. Maria looked at him affectionately. "He\'s not here…" "I know", said mary. "There\'s no-one here. jesus\'s replacement isn\'t here in the manger, simon. it\'s you." "But I\'m just a badly-made figurine." "You\'re not that badly made, if you managed to make no one notice that jesus wasn\'t really here. look, simon, you have done what jesus does best: love everyone so much that they feel truly special. didn\'t you feel the same way when he looked at you every day? now everyone else gets that same feeling thanks to you." Simon smiled. "Jesus has asked me to tell you to keep the secret. he is still out looking for replacements like you in all corners of the world, to make it a better place. would you still like to be the invisible boy in this nativity?"

However, one day, the trumpet disappeared, and everyone in that land ended up feeling sad. No one did anything, except for a little girl who went off, determined to find the trumpet. She asked everywhere, and then someone took her to see the wise old man of the mountains. The man told her that the trumpet was in the well of shadows, and he gave her a violin which might turn out to be useful. When the girl arrived at the well, she found some musicians next to it. They were playing sad tunes, and she went over to play with them. However, on hearing such sad music, the girl realised that no one, including the trumpet, would want to come out of the well to be greeted by that kind of atmosphere. So she started to play the cheeriest, happiest music she could. She didn't give up, and even managed to cheer up the other musicians. Together they improved the atmosphere around the well so much that the trumpet came out, more joyful than ever. And, once again, happiness returned to that land. Thanks to this, the girl realised the value of offering joy to others, it being the best remedy for those who are sad. And from that day onwards, in that land, anyone who saw someone looking sad would send them their happiest smiles, along with a little music.

["One night, a hedgehog was scanning the sky with his telescope, when he saw what seemed to be a spaceship flying to the moon. When he managed to properly focus on it, he found out that it was a craft belonging to an unfortunate martian who seemed to have had an accident, and had to make an emergency landing on the moon. The hedgehog realised that surely only he himself had seen this, so he decided to try to save the martian. He called together a few animals to help. They couldn't think what to do, so they called for more and more animals to join in. In the end, practically everyone in the forest was involved. It occurred to them that if they stood on top of each other, they could build a big tower and perhaps reach the moon. That proved somewhat difficult, and most animals ended up having had a finger in their eye, someone's foot in their ear, and numerous bumps on the head. However, after much perseverance, they finally reached the moon and rescued the martian. Most unfortunately, while he was coming down the tower of animals, the bear couldn't help sneezing. He happened to be allergic to moon dust. The whole tower crashed to earth with a great din comprising howls, roars, and other assorted animal cries. Seeing all this, the martian thought that the animals would very angry with him because they would blame it all on him. But it was just the opposite. As they recovered from the fall, the animals jumped and clapped with joy, happy to have achieved something so difficult together. The whole day was spent partying. The martian observed everything, and when he returned to his planet the other martians were astonished at what had happened. And so it was that those simple and helpful animals taught the martians the importance of working together, joyfully, in a team. Since then, martians no longer travel alone during their journeys through space. Now they go in groups, always willing to help each other, and make sacrifices whenever necessary. ", 'The satisfaction of working together in friendship is much greater than the minor inconveniences it brings. ', 15]

["There was once a little boy who told tales about absolutely everything. Whenever anyone asked who had done this, or who had said that, the little boy jumped up and shouted out the guilty person's name. At his school the children ended up never speaking to each other; they were tired of the little boy using their words to tell tales. Because they no longer spoke, the children started to lose their voices, until no one could say anything at all. This made things very boring for the little boy. He was left on his own, feeling lonely, and the others resented him for being the cause of everyone losing their voice…wondering what he could do to solve the problem, it occurred to him that he could become the one who asks the questions, and leaves them unanswered. This plan worked, and now that there were so many questions needing an answer, everyone's voices gradually started working again. Even better, people became friendlier towards him for having cured them. And so it was that he learned not to tell tales about everything. He realised it was much more fun to let others speak for themselves. ", 'Telling tales about others is not only unfriendly, it also hinders others from telling their stories themselves. ', 15]
['A long time ago, in an italian city, they built a beautiful tower which was admired by everyone passing through. A little further down the road, in a neighbouring city, they had built a tower of similar beauty. The two towers were equally well known. The people of the second city, envious and filled with pride, planned to destroy the neighbouring tower so it wouldn\'t take attention away from their own. One dark night, they came to the tower, with picks and shovels, and began to quietly undermine its foundations. The next morning, the tower was leaning slightly, but nobody seemed to notice. The same happened for the following few days, until a little girl who was passing by pointed up at the tower and said: "I think that the tower is going to fall down." And everyone around looked closely, and could see that she was right. Nervousness spread through the city. They tried no end of solutions to try to straighten the tower, but the days passed, and nothing seemed to work. That was, until one day when the same little girl was walking by again, and she leant her arm on the side of the tower, to rest. She felt the tower trembling slightly, amid the sound of creaking and groaning. When she took her hand off it, the movement and the noises stopped. And when she put it back on again, the same happened. The girl spent a while doing this, until she was completely certain of what she had discovered: "The tower is ticklish!!"She ran to get some flowers and plants, and she planted them right next to the tower. Now if the tower leant over any further it would be tickled by the petals and leaves of those plants. Being a ticklish tower, it would then have to return back to where it had been. In this way, the girl managed to make sure that the tower didn\'t collapse, but still kept it leaning a little. The fact that it was leaning made it even more famous, and this taught a fine lesson to the envious people of the neighbouring city. Being jealous types, they tried to copy the lean of the first tower, but they couldn\'t do it, and the tower ended up collapsing, leaving the city not only without a tower, but also without a city hall. ', 'When we fail to appreciate the good things others possess, and allow envy to take over, we end up in a lot of trouble. ', 15]
['Once upon a time there was a place where animals were suffering greatly from drought and hunger. A very poor bunny was walking sadly through the fields when, all of a sudden, a wizard appeared in front of him. The wizard offered the bunny a bag filled with little bouquets of flowers. "They are magical, and they\'re even more magical if you know how to use them properly", said the wizard. The bunny was dying of hunger, but he decided not to eat the bouquets. He wanted to put them to good use. On his way home, the bunny met a very old and very poor sheep who could hardly walk any more. "Can you spare me something?" Asked the sheep. The bunny had nothing except his bouquets, and since they were magical, he was reluctant to give them to the sheep. But he remembered how his parents had always taught him to share everything; so he pulled a bouquet out of the bag and gave it to the sheep. As soon as he did this, the bunch shone with a thousand colours. Magic was at work. The bunny continued on his way, feeling both happy and a bit annoyed. He had given away one of the bouquets, but at the same time it was obvious that the sheep needed it more than he did. As he continued his journey, the very same thing happened to the bunny when he met a blind duck and then a lame cockerel. When the bunny arrived home, he had only one magical bouquet left. He told his parents all about what had happened with the wizard, and his parents were very proud of the bunny\'s behaviour. He was about to pull out the final bouquet, when his little brother arrived home, crying with hunger. The bunny gave his brother the magical bouquet. At that moment, with a great rumble of thunder, the wizard appeared again. He asked the bunny "Where are the magical bouquets I gave you? what have you done with them?" The bunny was frightened and he started to apologise. But the wizard interrupted, saying "Didn\'t I tell you that if you used them well they\'d be even more magical? well, go outside and see what you\'ve done!"The bunny went out, shaking. And what he saw was that, thanks to the way he had used his magical bouquets, for as far as the eye could see the whole countryside had turned into wonderful, green farmland. Farmland with enough water and food to feed all the animals! And the bunny felt very happy that he had acted as he had, and that the magic of his generosity would bring happiness to everyone.

['There was once a rather amusing king. It was very unusual. No matter how many times he told people to do things, they would never obey him. As he was also a peaceful and just king, who didn\'t want to punish or imprison anyone, he ended up with no authority. So the king decided to get a great wizard to come up with a magic potion which would get people to obey him. The old wizard - the wisest man in the kingdom - cast a thousand spells, and made just as many potions. They produced some interesting results, like a fighting snail, or a dancing ant… but he couldn\'t find a way to get people to obey the king. A young man, who was passing through, heard about the problem, and went quickly to the palace, telling the king that he knew the solution. The king seemed excited, and the young man gave him two small pieces of parchment, with incredibly colourful writing on them. -"These are the spells that I have prepared for you, your highness. use the first before saying that which you want your subjects to do, and use the second when they have done it. a smile will indicate that the person remains under your power. do this, and the spell will last forever."Everyone was intrigued, curious to hear the spells; especially the king. Before using them he read them several times to himself, trying to memorise them. A servant was passing by, carrying a large turkey in his arms. The king said to him, -"Please, apolonio, come here and let me see that magnificent turkey."Apolonio, surprised by the king\'s kindness, and never having heard him say \'please\' before, approached the king. The king, and everyone else there, was surprised by how effective the spell had proven. The king, after looking at the turkey with little interest, said, -"Thank you, apolonio, you may go." And the servant left, smiling. It had worked! And, even better, apolonio remained under the king\'s power, just as the young man had said! The grateful king, festooned the young man with riches, and the young man decided to continue on his journey. But before he left, the old wizard approached him, asking him where he had gotten his extraordinary magical powers, begging the man to share them with him. The young man, who was nothing more than an intelligent teacher, told the wizard the truth:   -"My magic does not lie in those worthless parchments which I wrote on arriving at the palace. I got my magic from school as a child. my teacher constantly repeated that with good manners you could get anything. and he was right. your good king only needed good manners and some politeness to get just what he wanted."The wizard, understanding the truth of this, spent that night destroying all his contraptions, and magical junk. He replaced them with a good book on manners, ready to continue educating his blunt and impolite king. ', 'Good manners so facilitate communication with others that they allow you to get much more than by using authority. ', 15]
['Bobby the mountain climber was famous for his attempts to climb the big snowy mountain. He had tried it at least thirty times, but had always failed. He began the ascent at a good pace, focussing on the snowy summit, imagining the marvellous view and the sense of freedom up there. But as he went on, and his strength dwindled, his gaze would lower, and more often would he look at his worn out boots. Finally, when the clouds had gathered round him, and he understood that he wouldn\'t be able to enjoy the view from the summit that day, he would sit down to rest, relieved to be able to start the descent back down to the village, though slightly worried about all the jokes he would have to endure. On one of these occasions he went up the mountain accompanied by old peeper, the town optician, who bore witness to the failure. It was peeper who most encouraged bobby to try again, and he presented him with a pair of special sunglasses. "If it starts clouding over, put these glasses on, or if your feet start hurting put them on too. these are special glasses; they\'ll help you."Bobby accepted the gift without giving it much mind, but when his feet started hurting again he remembered what peeper had said, and he put on the glasses. The pain was pretty bad, but with those new sunglasses he could still manage to see the snow-covered summit; so on he continued. Just as nearly always seemed to happen, misfortune returned in the form of cloud cover. But this time it was so light that he could still see the summit through the clouds. And so bobby kept climbing, leaving the clouds behind, forgetting his pain, and finally arriving at the summit. It was certainly worth it. His feeling of triumph was incomparable; almost as magnificent as that wonderful view, resplendent in its silence, the mountain below surrounded by a dense sea of clouds. Bobby didn\'t remember the clouds being as thick as that, so he looked more closely at the sunglasses, and understood everything. Peeper had engraved a light image on the lenses, in the form of the snow-covered summit. It was made in such a way that you could only see it if you looked upwards. Peeper had understood that whenever bobby lost sight of his objective, he would similarly lose sight of his dream, and his will to continue would wane. Bobby realised that the only obstacle to reaching the summit had been his own discouragement. When he could no longer see the top of the mountain, the problems had set in. He thanked peeper for using that little trick to help him see that his aims were not impossible, and that they were still there, where they had always been.

['A long, long time ago, thousands of children in the world didn\'t know how to tell whether they were treating others well or badly.

When alicia went to bed, the pillow would ask her:    -"Tell me, my girl, what did you do today?"Whenever alicia told her that she had done bad things, the pillow would make annoying noises through the night, and contort itself into all kinds of uncomfortable lumps and bumps. Of course, alicia could hardly get any sleep. But when alicia talked of good things she had done, the pillow would purr like a pussycat, would wish alicia a good night, and would play sweet soft music the whole night through. Before long, the girl had learnt how to behave so that her pillow would play lovely music every night. Sparkles the fairy then decided to use the pillow on another little girl who was giving her a lot of trouble. At first, alicia was afraid that she might forget how to be good, but she remembered the words she had heard every night, and she would say to herself:    -"Let\'s see then, alicia. what did you do today?"Alicia was pleased to find that she herself now knew whether she had behaved well or not.

["To get some idea of the size of the molokos you have to see them from afar. If you were to put yourself next to them, they wouldn't even see you, and if the biggest of our fairytale giants were to be at their side, probably the enormous molokos still wouldn't see them. Maybe the best way to know what they're like is to know what their favourite food is. To your average moloko there's nothing more delicious than a huge planet, with its oceans, deserts and mountains. And from all of them, there's no one like the great tuton. As big as a star, he could swallow a medium-sized planet in one gulp. He was also great at finding the tastiest planets, and this had made him the most famous of the molokos. But even greater than his fame as an explorer was his fame for being so selfish, since he never shared even a morsel of his wonderful meals, so the other molokos only just managed to samples some crumbs left from the mountains. For thousands of years - because molokos live a very long time so that they can grow so big -  tuton dined on the best planets. But it so happened that one of those planets, a lovely one of red, blue and yellow, whose crust had the best flavour you could imagine, turned out to have a centre made of the hardest steel in the universe, and the previously indestructible teeth of our famous moloko shattered into a thousand pieces. Nothing like that had ever happened to a moloko, and it turned out to be the worst of eventualities. So many mouth-watering planets within his reach, and he didn't even have a single tooth to make an impression on them. And when he asked for help from the other molokos, they all remembered his old selfishness, and how he had never left them anything but the smallest crumbs of planets whose flavour was of much worse flavour than what tuton had been accustomed to. And the previously colossal and famous planet eater became a beggar, going through all kinds of suffering and calamity. All he knew was crying, asking, begging… and hunger. And he had to spend a long time living like that, until he realised that if he wanted to be given something he would have to be the first to give, even though he was as miserable and poor as he was. And thinking about the little he had to give, he realised that he was still a brilliant discoverer of the tastiest planets. So he talked with some other molokos, and he offered to show them where the best planets hid themselves. What great joy for everyone! They discovered flavours they didn't know even existed. And the molokos, grateful to tuton for sharing with them his great skill, became much more attentive to him, and never again did he lack someone to help crush up some mountains or make him a lovely desert juice.

["According to an ancient legend, during a very hot period the big snowy mountain lost her covering of snow and, with it, all her cheerfulness. Streams dried up, trees withered and the mountain became covered in grim grey rock. The moon, who was always bright and shining, wanted to help her friend. However, she was very kind but not very clever and the only thing that occurred to her was to make a hole in her lower part and blow through it softly. In this way, a small amount of the magic dust that made her shine would fall on the mountain in the form of light snow. Once opened, nobody could seal the hole again. The moon didn't mind, however. She continued to blow and after several nights lost all her white dust. Without it, the moon looked so empty that she was almost invisible and the nights became completely dark and sad. Upset by this, the mountain wanted to give the snow back to her friend. However, because it was impossible to make it snow upwards, she lit a fire inside herself until she became a volcano. The fire turned the snow into a dense white smoke that rose up as high as the moon, filling her gradually each night until she was once again full and bright. However, when the snow stopped, and with it the smoke, the hole in the moon remained open, and she had no choice but to share her magic again until she was hollow once more. The moon set off on her travels in the hope of finding another mountain who could turn into a volcano, and she came across a town that needed her help desperately. She was too weak to stop her kind heart so she blew on the town, filling it with happiness until she herself stopped shining. It seemed as if the moon would never shine again but, just like the mountain, the grateful town also found a way to make it snow upwards. So did the next one, and the next, and every one after that. And so, every month, the moon generously sprinkles her magic dust across the world until she disappears, knowing that in a few days her friends would find a way to make her shine brightly again.

The sword was greatly excited at the prospect of taking part in its first real battle. It would show everyone how truly brave and special it was, and would become renowned throughout the kingdom. On the way to the front line, the sword imagined itself the winner of many battles. However, when they arrived, the first battle had already taken place, and the sword got to see the results of war. What it saw had nothing in common with what the sword had imagined. No elegant shining knights, triumphant, with their weapons gleaming in the sunlight. Instead, all the sword saw was broken weapons, and hordes of hungry and thirsty men. There was hardly any food left. Everything was covered in dirt and shrouded in a disgusting smell.

It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big final battle, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a low buzz, but this gradually got louder, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the king\'s sword what it was doing.

One answered, "No one likes it, but what can we do?""Make yourself vibrate, just like I\'m doing", said the king\'s sword.

['August heat was a little city mouse who lived peacefully in a big house. The house had all the comforts any mouse could ever dream of; there was always warm water to bathe in, hot food, plenty of clothes and whatever else. A rather unusual kind of mouse lived with august. His name was percy veering, and despite all those comforts, every day he would give something up. He could quite easily wash in cold water as if it were warm, or chew leeks as though they were lumps of cheese. The worst was when he tried to convince august that acting in this way would be for his own good. "Come on, man, you\'ll make yourself stronger. you\'re becoming a real softy!", percy would say to him. And poor august would turn away, snuggle into his blanket, and read a good book, wondering how there could be such stupid people around. Misfortune would have it that, one night, so much snow fell on the city that our two friends\' little mouse-house was completely snowed in and cut off from the outside world. They tried to get out, but the cold was intense, and they didn\'t think they could dig a tunnel through so much snow. They decided to wait it out. The days went by, and still the snow remained; now there was no food left. Percy endured it quite well, but august - deprived of his hot baths, his food, and his warm shelter, was on the verge of losing control. He was a cultured kind of a mouse, who had studied widely; he knew that he wouldn\'t be able to stand more than three days without food. This was the same amount of time they had worked out they would need to dig a tunnel through the snow. They now had no choice but to get digging. But as soon as he touched that cold snow, august turned away. He couldn\'t do it. Not with something so terribly cold, not even as hungry as he was, not even knowing that he would soon die! Percy, though, managed it quite well, and started digging, all the time encouraging his friend to do the same. But august was paralysed; he just could not stand such terrible conditions. He couldn\'t even think straight. Then he looked at percy, \'that idiot\', and understood that that mouse was a lot wiser than he looked. Unlike himself, percy had trained himself to do things because he really wanted to do them, and not just because they were the most appealing things to do at any given moment. He could order his legs to dig regardless of whether they were purple with cold - something which was impossible for august, no matter how much he wanted to do it. And with those thoughts, and a tear of helplessness, he lay down upon the mountain of feathers that was his bed, ready to let himself die. When he opened his eyes, he thought he was in heaven; the face of an angel was smiling at him. But then with great joy he realised that it was just a nurse. She told him they had been treating him for days, ever since a very brave mouse had arrived at the hospital, his four legs frozen, and given instructions on where to find august. Then the brave mouse had passed out. When august ran to thank percy for all his help, he found him standing up, having greatly recovered. Percy had lost several fingers, and an ear, but he looked cheerful enough. August felt very guilty since he hadn\'t lost a thing. Percy told him, "Don\'t worry, if it hadn\'t been for those fingers and that ear, I wouldn\'t be here either. what better use could they have had?!"Of course, they continued to be great friends, but august no longer thought of percy as an idiot. By percy\'s side he set about regaining control over his own pampered and demanding little body, each day giving up one of those unnecessary comforts of modern mouse life.

And even then, he still had enough left over for a toy. He was the clear winner, and the rest of his cousins learnt from him the advantages of knowing how to save and how to wait. There was also julia. Poor julia didn\'t enjoy the day of the competition, because even though she had had a wonderful secret plan, she had spent her money without giving her plan enough time to work. However, she was so sure that her plan was a good one, that she decided to carry on with it, and maybe change the expressions on her relatives\' faces, who had seemed to be saying "What a disaster that girl is. she couldn\'t manage to save anything."When she was about to complete the second year of her plan, julia surprised everyone by turning up at the grandparents\' house with a violin and a lot of money. What was even more impressive was hearing her play. She did it really well. Everyone knew that julia adored the violin, even though the family couldn\'t afford to pay for her to have lessons. So julia had got to know a poor violinist who played in the park, and she offered him all the coins her grandfather had given her, if he would teach her how to play. Although it wasn\'t much money, on seeing julia\'s excitement, the violinist agreed, and he taught her happily for months. Julia showed so much desire and interest that a little after a year the violinist loaned her a violin so they could play together in the park, as a duo. They were so successful that gradually she managed to buy her own violin, with quite a bit of money to spare. From then on, the whole family helped her, and she became a very famous violinist. And she would always tell people how it was possible, with just a few coins well spent, to make your wildest dreams a reality.

['Soppo was an enormous giant, the biggest there had ever been. He could drink a river dry, or eat a whole forest as if it were a salad. And, without doubt, his favourite delicacy was the clouds in the sky; fresh, spongy, the kind he ate so many of that he\'d almost always end up with an upset stomach. He\'d have such pains in his belly that he\'d end up crying, and the flow of his tears created great floods and torrents. Soppo lived quietly and just how he liked, fearing nothing and no one, coming and going as he pleased. However, despite all that he wasn\'t happy: he didn\'t have even one single friend. What\'s more, every time he visited a country, there was nothing but problems: with him eating so many clouds the rains for the crops would disappear and, what with his stomach aches and crying, everything would then get flooded, not to mention all the woods and farms he would eat his way through… in the end, whenever he was spotted, everyone would flee in terror, and soppo never got to spend any time with anyone at all. One night, seeing him crying, various stars came down and asked him why he was so sad. On hearing his story they commented:   -"Poor giant. he doesn\'t know how to make friends. yet the earth is the most special planet of all, and it\'s full of all kinds of friends." -"But, where can I find friends? how do I do that?" Replied the giant. -"By giving people a hand or doing something for them. that is what makes friendship. you didn\'t know that?" Replied the stars, amused. -"Gee," Sighed soppo    -"That never occurred to me. what did you guys do to make friends?" -"Well, we learned to show people the way at night time, and serve as guides to many sailors. they\'re great friends. they tell us stories and keep us company every night."So the giant and the stars kept chatting a while, and over the following days soppo thought about nothing else but ways to find friends. But he couldn\'t think of any way to manage it. Several days later he went to ask for help from the moon. Being old and wise the moon answered:   -"You won\'t know how to help someone until you know them well. what do you know about these people you want to become your friends?"Soppo thought for a while, because really he knew hardly anything about human beings. They were so small that he\'d never worried much about them. So he thought to himself he would find out about them, and he spent long days observing their little lives. This is how he discovered why everyone ran off when seeing him, and he realised he was causing droughts by eating all the clouds, and that his weeping flooded them out, and he learned a thousand other things that filled him pity and joy. That night the giant ran to greet the stars. -"Now I know how I\'m going to make friends…. by eating and crying!!"And so it was. From that day on, soppo watched the skies, and when the clouds were preparing enormous storms he would feast himself on some of them. Then, when he spotted some place where there was a shortage of water, he would cry above it. Before long, soppo changed from being the worse that could happen to a country, to being a blessing for everyone, and he was never short of a good friend to spend a while with, to listen to, or to offer a helping hand.

['Peggy pigtails was a good girl, and she was quite quiet and reserved. Not many words passed her lips, partly due to shyness, and partly because she sometimes felt she had nothing interesting to say. But that all changed when peggy and her family moved houses. On arriving at the new place, she discovered a huge attic full of old junk. In one pile she found a big chest containing all kinds of strange things. Under them all, she found something special. It was an old book with a great heavy, thick cover, with gold writing on it. But what made it truly special was how it shone in the darkness of that attic, and in the most magical, fantastical way. What\'s more, the book was actually floating in the air. Peggy could find nothing holding it up. She took the book down to her room and hid it there until nighttime, putting her puppy on guard duty over it. That night, when she was sure no one would disturb her, she sat with her doggy and started reading the book. It was a storybook, but peggy could hardly get any of it read. She had only just started when her dog started speaking to her:"What an interesting book you\'ve found! it seems to have some lovely stories!" Peggy couldn\'t believe it, but the puppy continued talking, telling her all sorts of things, and asking a thousand questions. After some time, peggy regained her composure and asked,    "So how come you\'re talking?" "I don\'t know," Answered the dog. "Instead of just thinking things, now I\'m saying them too… it hasn\'t changed much for me; I guess it was the book that did it, though."Peggy decided to investigate the matter, and she thought she would show the book to some other animals. One after another, the animals all started talking, and, before long, peggy was chatting - in the most friendly manner - with a dog, three cats, two doves, a parrot, and five lizards. All the animals spoke as though they\'d been doing so all their lives, and all of them had some pretty interesting tales to tell! "Sure, babe!" Lemmy the lizard told her, "We all lead pretty incredible lives!"Peggy pigtails spent the next several days nattering with her new friends, and really enjoyed it. One day, though, unaware as to why, the book disappeared; and with it went the animals\' voices. Peggy looked everywhere, but couldn\'t find that book. Within a few days, she was missing the chats with her new animal friends so much that she could hardly think of anything else. Then she remembered what lemmy the lizard said to her, and she realised that she hardly spoke at all to her classmates or other children, and they probably had incredible lives too! So, from that day, little by little, peggy started talking more to her schoolmates, trying to find out about their lives. In the end, without realising it, she came to have more friends than anyone else in the whole school. And never again was she short of someone to have a good old natter with.

['Raymond didn\'t want to learn how to read. So many letters stuck together seemed like an enormous bore to him. He couldn\'t understand why so many adults and other children enjoyed reading so much. He kept an eye on the letters and couldn\'t see anything of interest happening. He preferred hearing stories about monsters and horrible beasts. One day, he went to mr. Maskell\'s fancy dress shop. He loved that shop. Mr maskell could create the most amazing monster outfits, and every year there were many new ones, even when it must have been really difficult to make each one. That day the storeowner was reading, and this caught raymond\'s attention. -"Why do you read so much, when books say nothing interesting?" -"What do you mean?" Answered mr. Maskell. -"It\'s obvious, they say nothing about monsters or beasts", added raymond. -"I can\'t believe it!" Exclaimed mr. Maskell, surprised. "I still haven\'t told you my secret?"Then he showed raymond the book he was reading. -"What do you see here?"Reluctantly, and with some difficulty, raymond started reading it. -"No, no! not like that. you have to see all of it. if you want to get it, you have to step back a bit, and even maybe turn your head a bit. do you now see anything different?"Right that second raymond saw it: the lines and letters of the page formed a big picture which reminded him of a dinosaur! An enormous smile spread right across raymond\'s face. He started turning the pages, and discovered many other creatures traced out by the length of the lines. They were on the right, on the left, everywhere…   -"Well, now you know how I can invent so many monsters", said mr. Maskell, winking. -"All you have to do is read that page and then look at the shape of the lines to find which kind of monster is hiding there. did you know that everything has something special about it? you just have to know how to find it."Raymond left, excited by his new discovery. From then on, it was unusual to see him without a book in his hands, looking for whatever the page was hiding, and hardly realising that he was learning thousands of new things as he did so.

['Johnny jones was a nice, popular boy, who everyone loved. He was so much fun, so good, and so kind with everyone that they treated him wonderfully, always giving him presents and looking out for him. And as everything he needed was given to him without asking, johnny became weak. He was so spoiled by everyone that he couldn\'t endure any hardship, nor did he have any strength of will. You would think that him having a little stone in his shoe was almost killing him. If he felt cold he would put so many clothes on that you would think he was at the north pole. If it was hot, he couldn\'t keep his top on for even a minute. And if he were to fall and hurt himself… well, that was a nightmare. Someone would have to call an ambulance. He became so well known for being weak that one day johnny heard a mother saying to her son "Come on, my boy, get up and stop crying. you\'re behaving like johnny jones". That made johnny feel so ashamed that he didn\'t know what to do. But he was sure that he would prefer to be known as a good boy rather than a softie. For several days he tried to see how much he could put up with hardship. It was true: he couldn\'t endure anything. Any little pain made him cry like a tap. Worried, he spoke to his father about all this, though he was afraid maybe he would be laughed at for having such worries. His father, far from laughing at johnny, told him that the same had happened to him when he was a boy, but that a teacher had taught him a secret trick to turn him into the toughest boy of all. -"And what is the trick?" -"Eat a candy less, study a minute more, and count to five before crying". Johnny could not believe it. - "Just that?" - "Yes, just that." - said his father, -"It\'s very simple, but I warn you that it won\'t be easy."Johnny went off happy as a lark, ready to follow that advice to the letter. He went to see his mother, and she noticed how happy he was when she offered him two candies. "One candy less", thought johnny, so he only took one. It wasn\'t easy, though, and he realised his father and been right. To leave one candy sitting in his mother\'s hand really took it out of him! That same afternoon he had another chance to put the trick into practice, by studying for one minute more. The outcome was that he missed the first minute of his favourite program! But having achieved this gave him a great feeling of satisfaction. The same happened when he bumped into the corner of the kitchen table. He only managed to count to four before crying, but his mother was well impressed at that. Over the following days johnny kept applying the motto to his life. Eat one candy less, study one minute more, and count to five before crying. And the more he put this into practice, the easier it got.

["Once upon a time there was a very evil and unpleasant crook who only ever thought about how to get money. Seeing anyone happy bothered the crook enormously. What he hated most was when people were polite and courteous to each other, saying things like please and thank you, and don't mention it. It annoyed him even more if they were smiling when they said these things. The crook thought all those kinds of words were a useless waste, and weren't good for anything. So what he did was spend a lot of time inventing a machine which could steal words. With this machine, he planned to steal 'please', 'thank you', 'don't mention it', and similar words people used to be polite. He was convinced that no one would notice if those words were to suddenly disappear. When he had stolen these words, he intended to take them apart and sell the letters to book publishers. After he started up his machine, people would open their mouths, intending to say kind and polite things, but nothing came out. All those words ended up inside the big machine. Just as the crook had hoped, in the beginning nothing happened. It looked like people really didn't need to be polite after all. However, after a while, people started to feel like they were always in a bad mood, doing everything reluctantly, and feeling like everyone else was being forever demanding of them. So, within a few days, everyone was angry and arguing over the slightest little thing. The crook was terribly happy with his success, but he didn't count on a couple of very special little girls. Those girls were deaf, and had to communicate using sign language. Now, because the machine couldn't steal gestures, these girls continued being kind and polite. Soon they realised what had been happening to everyone else, and they found out about the crook and his wicked plan. The girls followed him to his hideout on the top of a hill next to the sea. There they found the enormous machine busy separating all the words into letters. The crook had gone to take a nap, so the girls crept up to the machine and started being polite and courteous to each other. Try as it might, the contraption couldn't steal those words, and it started to suffer a power overload, which got more and more serious as the girls went on communicating. Finally, it exploded, sending all the letters it had gathered flying into the sky. These letters started coming down, like rain, and most ended up in the sea. After that, everyone could be polite and thoughtful again. The anger and the arguments stopped, proving that good manners are very useful for keeping people together in a spirit of happiness.

['The little blue hummingbird felt sad and tired. He had become lost while traveling with his family, who were looking for a warmer place to spend the winter. When night came, after much time spent looking for them, but with no luck, he took refuge in a small cave he found in the mountainside. Inside the cave there were only a few dry twigs and leaves that had been blown their by the wind. Although feeding himself wasn\'t a worry, seeing as he had always been so good at it, not knowing whether he would see his loved ones again deeply saddened him. -"Don\'t stray far from us when we\'re migrating," His parents had always repeated to him. But he would get so excited at all the little things he would discover during their journeys, and there he would be, open-mouthed, contemplating these wonders, flapping his wings over every new treasure, while the others just carried on with the journey, not noticing his absence. That day, while flying, he had seen a flash of light, a reflection coming out of the trees, and without realising it, he swooped low and approached to see what was the source of the beautiful light. And he discovered an enormous, picturesque lake of crystalline waters; a sight that left him completely surprised. -"Wow!!" He exclaimed, seeing himself reflected in the water, -"How wonderful!!"He\'d never seen anything like it. The sun was beginning to fire its rays onto the water, and these became brilliant golden reflections that almost blinded you. It was a spectacular sight. There he played, flying over the water, playing with his own reflection; using the calm waters as a mirror, viewing the white clouds sliding past overhead. Time passed without him realising, and when he gained altitude and called for his family so he could show them what he\'d found, his call went unanswered. His parents and brothers and sisters had continued on with the journey, and they couldn\'t hear him. Suddenly an enormous fear arose in him. All that beauty disappeared from his eyes, and he could only hear strange noises that increased his fear and his feeling of uneasiness. Cries of strange birds echoed around the forest, and everything that had hitherto seemed beautiful turned into something gloomy and ghostly. The sun now seemed to cast only shade, and he was afraid of being left alone in the forest. He flew out of the trees, in search of his family, but the night came and he was still alone. So then he sought out a place to shelter and pass the night. With the little leaves he found in the cave he made a small nest. It was a bit noisy since the leaves were so dry, but at least it gave him some warmth that night. The following day, when he woke, he didn\'t remember that he\'d become lost, but soon after getting up it all came to mind, and he began worrying. -"Oh, my god! what will I do here alone? where is my family?" And he soon found out how much he missed them. His parents had always repeated to him that, if someday he should get lost, what he should do is not go far from the last place they had all been together, put himself in a place that was high enough so he could be seen when they returned, and that he should never allow fear to stop him seeing reality. -"It\'s true!!" He said, remembering this, -"My parents told me what I would have to do if I get lost, so I have nothing to be afraid of. my family is looking for me right now, and soon we\'ll be together."And so he left his little cave, thanking it for having given him shelter that night. Once again everything outside was beautiful, and the confidence that he would find his family made him fly happily in what was an unknown place for him. Before long he once more found the beautiful lake, and there he found the tallest tree, where he perched himself. While he was waiting he began humming, and gradually the little birds who lived there joined in with him. He told them he was lost, and the birds decided to sing really loudly so that anyone passing would hear them. Soon their song could be heard from very far off, and this helped his family to quickly find him. After that day, our little hummingbird was a bit wiser. Now he knew that he should always let his family know when was going to fly off from them during their travels. He also knew that during the course of his life he would meet others who would offer him their help. And, most important of all, he learned that when fear got the better of him the most beautiful things could come to appear the most terrifying.

Soon after noticing the ducks' tightrope practice, he came over and began praising them. He said they were doing great, and he bet they could cross any precipice on that rope of theirs.

['Some cranes saw a farmer plowing a large field. When the work of plowing was done, they patiently watched him sow the seed. It was their feast, they thought. So, as soon as the farmer had finished planting and had gone home, down they flew to the field, and began to eat as fast as they could. The farmer, of course, knew the cranes and their ways. He had had experience with such birds before. He soon returned to the field with a sling. But he did not bring any stones with him. He expected to scare the cranes just by swinging the sling in the air, and shouting loudly at them. At first the cranes flew away in great terror. But they soon began to see that none of them ever got hurt. They did not even hear the noise of stones whizzing through the air, and as for words, they would kill nobody. At last they paid no attention whatever to the farmer. The farmer saw that he would have to take other measures. He wanted to save at least some of his grain. So he loaded his sling with stones and killed several of the cranes. This had the effect the farmer wanted, for from that day the cranes visited his field no more.

['A fox that had been caught in a trap, succeeded at last, after much painful tugging, in getting away. But he had to leave his beautiful bushy tail behind him. For a long time he kept away from the other foxes, for he knew well enough that they would all make fun of him and crack jokes and laugh behind his back. But it was hard for him to live alone, and at last he thought of a plan that would perhaps help him out of his trouble. He called a meeting of all the foxes, saying that he had something of great importance to tell the tribe. When they were all gathered together, the fox without a tail got up and made a long speech about those foxes who had come to harm because of their tails. This one had been caught by hounds when his tail had become entangled in the hedge. That one had not been able to run fast enough because of the weight of his brush. Besides, it was well known, he said, that men hunt foxes simply for their tails, which they cut off as prizes of the hunt. With such proof of the danger and uselessness of having a tail, said master fox, he would advise every fox to cut it off, if he valued life and safety. When he had finished talking, an old fox arose, and said, smiling:"Master fox, kindly turn around for a moment, and you shall have your answer."When the poor fox without a tail turned around, there arose such a storm of jeers and hooting, that he saw how useless it was to try any longer to persuade the foxes to part with their tails.

['The weasels and the mice waged a perpetual war with each other,in which much blood was shed. The weasels were always thevictors. The mice thought that the cause of their frequentdefeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the generalarmy to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers fromlack of discipline. They therefore chose as leaders mice thatwere most renowned1 for their family descent, strength, andcounsel, as well as those most noted2 for their courage in thefight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array andformed into troops, regiments3, and battalions4.

["There was once a forest made up of tiny trees that were all growing up together. They had been planted by a very old labourer who took care that they would all grow up to be straight and healthy. However, the area was battered by strong winds, and the little trees preferred to avoid the bothersome gusts, so they bent their trunks and branches to shelter themselves. The old man, knowing they could never grow well like this, set about straightening them out, and spent many hours tying their slim trunks to supporting posts, hoping his beloved trees would understand he was doing this for their own good. But those naughty trees had no desire to put up with all that wind. It mattered not to them that the old man would promise them that when they were tall and upright the air wouldn't bother them a jot. They always got by by bending and twisting themselves, hiding from the wind. Only one of those trees, one located right in the middle of the forest, forced itself to grow up straight, patiently bearing the annoying gusts. The years passed, and the old man died. And from then on the trees could grow however they liked, bending and crouching from the wind just as they pleased, with no one bothering them about it. All, that is, except the single straight tree in the centre of the forest, who remained determined to grow up just as a tree should. But as the forest grew, and the trees got thicker and stronger, they began to hear cracks from inside. Their branches and trunks needed to keep growing, but the trees were so twisted that the inexorable growth they were experiencing only brought them pain and suffering, even more than the suffering they had avoided by staying out of the wind. Each day and night, in the depths of the forest, one could hear the cracking and snapping of the trees, and it sounded like groans and sobbing. And around that area the place became known as the wailing forest. And it was a place with a special charm since, right in its centre, surrounded by thousands of short, knotty, twisted trees, rose one impressive tree that was long and straight like no other. And that tree, the only one that never creaked or cracked, continued growing and growing, without a worry for the capricious wind and its accomplice, the breeze.

['When young nerino was made chief of the tribe, everyone expected that - as was the custom on the island - he would direct his attention to fighting the great fiery-eyed beast; a horrible creature that had terrorised the tribespeople for centuries. Nerino had promised to slay the beast and, though he was a good fighter, he seemed no better than the others who had previously perished in the attempt. The tribe reckoned that, as chief, he wouldn\'t last much more than a year. This was about the amount of time needed to train and prepare a band of warriors, prior to ascending to the volcano\'s summit, where their horrendous enemy lived. And once they got there, no matter how strong or brave they were, all the warriors would be annihilated within a couple of hours. However, nothing was done. Nerino didn\'t train any fighters, nothing out of the ordinary was done, no new assault tactics were devised. When summer came - the time the monster attacked most frequently, engulfing all in flames from his fiery eye - all the tribe did was move their village. Everyone looked worringly and insistently at nerino. They demanded that he fight, that he do something, that he should be brave and fulfil the destiny of a chief. But nerino simply said:    -"I shall defeat the beast, but now is not the time."And so the years passed by, and nerino became an old man. And though they respected him as their chief, and his strategy of moving their village around the island had saved many lives, all the people believed he was a coward. Yet, just when no-one expected it, nerino finally assembled a squad of fighters. He announced this suddenly, without warning, on a cold winter night. Snow was rare on the island, but now it blanketed the ground, and the band of warriors had to march out barefoot, with frozen feet. They hurriedly ascended the volcano and, at the summit, they approached the monster\'s cave. Nerino confidently entered, while his companions performed the usual death preparation rituals, ready to leave this life…when they were all inside they cave they saw old nerino standing over the beast. The monster was lying, curled up, on the ground, trembling and groaning, close to death. Nerino and his warriors easily took the creature prisoner. On arriving back at the village, everyone wanted to hear about nerino\'s fight with the monster. Not even the tiniest baby was absent when nerino began telling his story:   -"I never intended to fight against something so terrifying, and nor did I do so today," He said, filling all with surprise and expectation. He continued. -"Did none of you notice that the beast would never attack during the worst days of winter? or that, after an especially cold spell, his fire was never very strong, nor his attacks very damaging? for many years I was waiting for a snow as heavy as this one. all along, we didn\'t need fighters; we needed the cold. when we got to the volcano, the monster was so weak he couldn\'t fight. finally we have put an end to fighting and death. now we have the beast, and his fiery eye, at our service."Everyone congratulated the chief for his wisdom, particularly those who had most criticised him for supposed cowardice. And so it was that even the most impatient among the tribe learned that, sometimes, patience can be much more useful than action, even if it means you require the bravery to accept people treating you like a coward.

["There was once a boy who was afraid of the dark. He thought that when it was dark his bedroom filled up with monsters. But there came a time when he was too old to be allowed to keep sleeping with the light on. That first night he was paralysed with fear, his mind full of monsters. So much so, that he went over to his wardrobe to get a torch. But when he opened the wardrobe door he came face to face with a monster, and he let out the loudest scream in the world. The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and… started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there. The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair. The two of them talked so much that they became quite friendly, and they realised that both of them had been afraid of the same thing: the unknown. To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons… it was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends. And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night.

['There was once a heroic knight. He was one of the knights whose triumphant deeds are still recounted in the old stories, in all languages, everywhere. His bravery was great, and his sword was feared, but he was tired of hunting for dragons, ogres and monsters in story after story. He decided to abandon that fairytale world, and come and test out his bravery and skill in the real world. However, when he arrived here, he found no terrible creatures, no evil wizards, not even a poor stepmother to wave his sword at. It was very strange. All he saw were worried people, with the same looks on their faces as he had seen on the faces of people he was rescuing from dragons or ogres. It didn\'t seem like there was anyone to put them in such fear, or to make them live in a state of such anxiety. Everyone hurried here and there, not speaking to anyone, as though something terrible was about to happen. But, at the end of the day, nothing really bad had ever happened. And so it was, day after day. The knight thought that maybe this could turn out to be his most heroic adventure ever, and he decided to totally devote himself to finding the source of this mysterious worry in the real world. He searched, he inquired, he investigated, he sailed, he climbed… but he found nothing. Not willing to give up, he returned to the fairytale world to speak to the wise old man. "Tell me, wise one. what is the great invisible enemy that strikes fear into the hearts of people in the real world? I still haven\'t found it, but I won\'t rest until I have defeated whatever it is, and freed everyone. just like I did here, for so many cities."The wise old man was quiet for a long while, then finally said: "You have neither the strength nor courage to win this battle. the enemy does not exist, yet it is powerful, and as numerous as the stars in the sky." "What?!" Protested the knight, "Is that even possible?" "In the real world, because they have no dragons or ogres, they invent their enemies, and they carry them inside. each person there has an enemy made to measure, which lives inside their heart. for some it is called greed, for others envy, for others selfishness, pessimism or desperation. they have sown the seeds of negativity in their souls, and take the fruits with them wherever they go. it is no easy task to uproot all that." "I will do it," Answered the knight, "I will set them free."And so the knight returned to the real world, bringing all his weapons with him. Everyone he met, he would offer to free them from their negative inner life. However, no one paid him the slightest attention, all he found was indifference and looks of surprise. Finally, exhausted and confused, he threw down his weapons and went over to a rock at the side of the road, to rest. On his way there he tripped over his sword, and fell to the ground, knocking his head against a cockerel which had been crowing in the vicinity. A sad looking little man was passing by, and when he saw this he burst out laughing, so much so that he could hardly stay on his feet. The knight was angry, but on looking closely at the man, he could see in his eyes a joyful shine that he had never yet seen in the real world…and so it was, that the knight finally found the solution to the deep sickness of the people in the real world. They only needed a smile, a laugh, a little help to banish their negative feelings, and to finally enjoy life… from that day on, the knight, armed with a big smile, started recruiting an army of liberators: a large and growing group of people able to remind anyone of the joy that is life. And what do you know! The knight won the battle just as impressively as he always had.

But, one year, there was such an incredibly hot summer that the lake\'s water really warmed up. Gail, used to such an ideal existence, could hardly stand the hot water.

So much so, that one day, the cheeky cockroach got fed up with her showing off, and decided to teach her a lesson. She went to see the butterfly, and in front of everyone she told her that she wasn\'t really that beautiful, and that if the butterfly won contests it was because the jury had been bribed.

["Charlie was a rich boy who had more toys than you could imagine. His family had a lot of money, and whenever he liked something, they would buy it for him. In reality, then, he had no idea what things cost, and wouldn't bother to take care of what he had. Nor did he realise how difficult it was for other children to get toys like the ones he had. A time came, though, when he was so used to all his toys and various stuff, that he began to want something different. One of his uncles found a fine horse and he gave it to charlie, as something unusual. Charlie was very excited at having a horse. He learned to ride, and was constantly on his horse, going here and there. However, he treated the horse just as badly as he did all his other toys, and it soon started looking neglected and sick. For the first time in his life charlie became truly worried. He loved the horse, and the fact that his family had offered to swap it for a new one meant nothing to him. One day, while in the countryside, he saw a girl with a horse. The girl looked very poor, but the horse seemed happy and looked great. Wondering how she had managed this, charlie secretly followed them, watching everything they did. First he followed them through the forest, where he saw that she never used the whip, and never hit the horse. This was the opposite of what charlie had done to his horse, right from day one. Then they came to the stable, and as soon as they arrived the girl fed and watered the horse. Then she carefully groomed it. Charlie was surprised. He'd never done any of that for his horse. He saw that the girl spent a lot of time giving care and attention to her horse, and that she did it all on her own. This had never entered into charlie's mind; he had always been too preoccupied with playing and having fun to look after the horse. Charlie wanted to change and become like the girl. As no one had shown him how to do this, he went over to her and asked her to teach him how to look after his horse. After her initial surprise, she happily accepted. With her he learned how to put care and effort into things, and that if you did so you enjoyed them much more. He learned that you could be much happier with only a few special things that you truly cared for and looked after, than with thousands of toys that were only good for a short time and were then thrown aside. But not everything was easy. Charlie also learned that the care put into these things was sometimes difficult, and it needed dedication of time and effort to do it well. So much so, that it even crossed his mind to go back to his old way of treating his horse. However, when the horse finally recovered all its strength and splendour, that first ride, alongside the girl, made him so happy that a doubling of his effort would have been worthwhile. As a result, charlie gave up constantly asking for new toys. Grateful to his friend, he gave her many of his own toys, and more to the children of the village. He only kept those few toys he really liked. And, just as he had learned with the horse, he set himself to repairing and caring for those toys, so he could really enjoy playing with them. ", 'You enjoy your toys more when you look after them. ', 17]
['There was once a wolf who got very little to eat because the dogs of the village were so wide awake and watchful. He was really nothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to think of it. One night this wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat house dog who had wandered a little too far from home. The wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the house dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it. So the wolf spoke very humbly to the dog, complimenting him on his fine appearance. "You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to," Replied the dog. "Leave the woods; there you live miserably. why, you have to fight hard for every bite you get. follow my example and you will get along beautifully.""What must I do?" Asked the wolf. "Hardly anything," Answered the house dog. "Chase people who carry canes, bark at beggars, and fawn on the people of the house. in return you will get tidbits of every kind, chicken bones, choice bits of meat, sugar, cake, and much more beside, not to speak of kind words and caresses."The wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that he almost wept. But just then he noticed that the hair on the dog\'s neck was worn and the skin was chafed. "What is that on your neck?""Nothing at all," Replied the dog. "What! nothing!""Oh, just a trifle!""But please tell me.""Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened.""What! a chain!" Cried the wolf. "Don\'t you go wherever you please?""Not always! but what\'s the difference?" Replied the dog. "All the difference in the world! I don\'t care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn\'t take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price." And away ran the wolf to the woods. ', 'There is nothing worth so much as liberty.

['In a garden filled with bushes, out from between a load of grass and weeds, there appeared, as if from nowhere, a white rose. It was as white as driven snow, its petals looked like velvet, and the morning dew shone from its leaves like resplendent crystals. The flower couldn\'t see herself, so she had no idea how pretty she was. And so it was that she spent the few days of her life, until wilting set on, without knowing that all around her were amazed by her and her perfection: her perfume, the softness of her petals, her elegance. She didn\'t realise that everyone who saw her spoke well of her. The weeds that surrounded her were fascinated by her beauty, and lived in a state of enchantment at her aroma and appearance. One hot, sunny day, a girl was strolling through the garden, thinking about how many lovely things mother nature has given us, when she suddenly saw a white rose in a forgotten part of the garden. The rose was beginning to fade and wilt. -"It\'s days since it rained," She thought, -"If the rose stays here till tomorrow it\'ll be totally withered. I\'ll take it home and put it in the lovely vase I got as a present."And so she did. With all her love she put the wilting white rose in water, inside a lovely colourful glass vase, and placed it by the window. -"I\'ll put it here," She thought, -"So the flower can get some sun."What the young girl didn\'t realise was that the reflection from the window meant that, for the first time, the rose got to see herself and what she looked like. -"Is that me?" Thought the rose. Little by little her drooping leaves began to rise, once again stretching up towards the sun, and, gradually, the rose recovered her former appearance. When she was totally back to her best she looked at her reflection and saw that she was indeed a beautiful flower. She thought    -"Wow! till now I hadn\'t realised who I was, how could I have been so blind?"The rose came to realise she had spent her days without appreciating her beauty, unable to see herself, unable to know who she really was. If you really want to know who you are, forget everything that\'s around you, and just look into your heart. ', 'We are all valuable in ourselves; much more so than we sometimes believe. ', 17]

Their two daughters, princess nora and princess sabina, managed to survive. After this tragedy, nora understood that she, being the elder sister, might be the princess mentioned in the prophecy. Accompanied by her sister, nora devoted herself to finding her new palace. During their travels they met a wise old man who gave them an old key that would open the palace doors. "I have no idea where the palace will be", said the old man, "All I know is that you should try this key wherever you seek it". And nora went with her sister, trying the key on all the palace doors they found.

["A long, long time ago, when everything was just starting out, and even the planets and stars were so young that they were still going to school, there was a special class which was everyone's favourite, having by far the most fun classmates. The class members were a bunch of rather mischievous colours; from black and white, through to red and blue, yellow, and all the rest. They hoped to grow up to be wonderful colours, and this is what they were training for. As well as funny and joyful, the colours were very naughty; particularly black and white, who were so preoccupied with causing mayhem that they were almost always late for class. One morning there was a great commotion in the sky. The clouds were up there, practicing their raining, but they had been raining for so long that they'd gone and created a storm so terrible that absolutely everyone had become saddened and depressed at having so little light. When the sun started shining again, not even that managed to cheer up the world. The only solution was to appeal, as a last resort, to the naughty, mischievous colours, even though they were still very young and weren't yet trained for anything like this. The authorities went straight to their classroom. It was still early, and, as ever, black and white hadn't yet turned up. However, there was no time to lose; they couldn't wait for black and white. The other colours had to do something fast. They ran down the corridors, out of the door, and flew up into the sky, where the clouds - ashamed for what had happened - were waiting. On their way up to the clouds each one of the colours left a resplendent trail. Travelling side by side, the combination of all the colours' trails was so striking and spectacular that smiles returned to everyone's face, and the world filled with the sound of applause. The colours felt honoured and delighted to be named as the sun's official assistants. And the inhabitants of the world begged them to promise that, from that day on, the colours would always be on hand, to help cheer everyone up. It was agreed that whenever the clouds overdid it on the rain, the colours would come quickly and make a rainbow. A bit later, black and white entered the classroom, finding it empty. Everyone was congratulating the other colours so much for their wonderful performance that black and white - really the most fun and happy of all the colours - didn't dare to ask to be part of the rainbow, and from that time onward they forced themselves to be punctual and responsible. Indeed, they managed this so well that now they don't mind being left out of the rainbow. They are now the most serious and important of all the colours, and no one can get anything done without them.

['The baby books were sad. This time the big and famous books hadn\'t just laughed at them, they had thrown them out. "You can hardly call yourselves books. you barely have any writing and are just all pictures", said one book that had lots and lots of pages written in tiny letters. "We won\'t let them put you next to us on the library shelf. you\'re not real books!", said another, very serious and fancy book. The poor baby books: they were not even allowed a little corner in bookshops or libraries. They ended up piled up in attics and warehouses. The big books were so happy. Only intelligent people and adults came into bookshops now given that there was nothing interesting for naughty children. The children stayed at the entrance, so the books were no longer scared that they would be manhandled or that their pages would be torn out and dirtied. Years passed and all those children who hadn\'t visited a library became adults. "Now they can come in and meet us and admire our wisdom", thought the big books. But no. The adults who had grown up without baby books had no interest in the big books. They were too long! How were they going to read so many pages all at once, if they had never read anything? The big books were desperate. Bookshops were closing down, libraries looked derelict. Nobody was reading! They all arranged a meeting, they read and read millions of their own pages and discovered that there was only one solution: they had to say sorry to the baby books and get them to come back and put them on the best shelves. That\'s how they managed to save themselves, by making children read little by little, so that they would grow up to be adults who loved big books. And so that nobody would forget what almost happened, they wrote the story in this baby book, which they give to everybody who thinks that books with few words and loads of pictures aren\'t real books.

['Giants and dragons had been enemies for years on end, but they had learned a lot. They were no longer so foolish as to wage wars with terrible battles in which thousands died. Now, every year they held bowling matches instead. A giant against a dragon. Whoever lost would become the winner\'s slave. If a dragon won, he could use the giant\'s muscles for all that heavy lifting. If a giant won, he would have free flights and fire for the whole year. That is how they prevented their deaths and yet they hated each other more and more. Every year the winners were so cruel to the losers, in revenge for the times they had lost. There came a time when what mattered most was not winning the bowling match, but rather not losing. Yonk the giant was the best bowler, and the most afraid. He had never lost. Many dragons had been his slaves and they were dying to see him lose so they could get their revenge. This is why yonk was terrified of losing. Especially since last year\'s match, when he missed his first ever strike and decided that something had to change. The following year he won again. When he arrived home, his slave dragon feared the worst but yonk had a different idea in mind. "This year you will not be my slave. we will go bowling and I will teach you all of my secrets. but you must promise me one thing: when you win your match next year, you will not be cruel to your giant. do the same as I am doing with you."The dragon gladly accepted. Yonk kept his promise and he spent the entire year without flying or warming himself with the dragon\'s fire breathing. The dragon also kept his promise and both did exactly the same every year afterwards. Yonk\'s idea became so popular that, within just a few years, many giants and dragons were spending their days bowling together. They forgot about their battles and cruelty and treated each other as play friends rather than enemies. Much later yonk lost his first bowling match but he was no longer afraid of losing because, by putting a stop to the enslavement of dragons, he had ended their hatred and sowed the seeds of an almost impossible peace between giants and dragons.

['John was a very shy child. He felt so embarrassed being with other people that he didn\'t dare say anything, and he almost always kept quite and still over in a corner, fearing what might happen if he opened his mouth. One day, when some people were visiting, juan felt so ashamed that he hid in a bedroom. Suddenly, a bubble appeared right in front of him, and out of it came a little elf. With exaggerated gestures of pain, the elf covered his large ears with his hands and shouted:   -"Please! please! stop screaming like that. I can not stand it…"With that shock the boy forgot his shyness, and asked the elf:   -"Why are you crying? who is shouting at you?" -"What d\'you mean who is shouting at me!? " He replied indignantly, -"Is there anyone else here?"The boy looked around. It was true, they were alone. -"What? but I almost never say anything … I\'m always really good," He said, trying to excuse himself. -"Oh, yeah!" Went on the elf without losing his anger    -"I really believe that. you were yelling like I haven\'t heard anyone yell for ages …" -"But if I didn\'t even open my mouth …" -"Go on! this really is good! as if to scream like a madman you have to open your mouth!" -"Of course," Replied john, -"How can I shout without opening my mouth?"Then the elf\'s face changed from anger to surprise. -"Aaahhh …." He said, lowering his voice, -"You mean you don\'t know? nobody told you that your eyes, your hands, your feet and your whole body talk all the time? now I understand everything!"And coming over to john, as if divulging a secret, the elf began to explain that each part of the body speaks its own language - and does so without stopping - and how each gesture we make says one thing or another, whether in a low voice or shouting. In the end the elf gave john a little bottle, dropped some magic droplets into the boy\'s ears, and told him:   -"Now you\'ll see what I\'m saying. with this potion you can be like me and hear with your ears what people are saying without a word passing their lips."It was an amazing experience for john. For a few days, he could hear how everyone kept up two or three conversations, even when completely silent. And he heard his parents say nice things to him simply by looking at him, and he heard his neighbour\'s feet complain because the lift was slow in coming, and he heard the butcher\'s head thank a generous lady for the tip she gave him. But what surprised him most was on his birthday when he met a girl who was also shy. She looked constantly to the ground and didn\'t dare talk to anyone. His magic ears could hear her loud cries:    -"I do not want to be here! I do not want to play with anyone! I hate parties!" And knowing what the girl\'s eyes and feet were saying wasn\'t true, he came and told her what they were shouting without her knowing about it, and he wet her ears with a few of the magic drops from his bottle. And that really made them feel ashamed! Together, john and his new friend set out to investigate which gestures and postures to make to ensure their bodies were quieter and more pleasant. And so it was that they discovered that smiling, looking into people\'s eyes, approaching people and politely saying "Hi" And "Bye" Meant their bodies stopped yelling, and so they became charming and pleasant children.

I will leave right now and start searching for a good man.."After some days, duryodhana came back to ashram and said to acharya, "I searched everywhere, searched far and wide but couldn\'t find any good man whom I can bring to you."Acharya replied, "Ok. now send yudhishthira to me."When yudhishthira  came to acharya, acharya said him, "Do one thing, go and search for a bad man and bring him to me."Yudhisthira agreed and set out to search.

["Once upon a time, there lived a herd of eighty thousand elephants at the bottom of the majestic himalayas. Their leader was a magnificent and rare white elephant who was an extremely kind-hearten soul. He greatly loved his mother who had grown blind and feeble and could not look out for herself. Each day this white elephant would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the best of wild fruit to send to his mother. But alas, his mother never received any. This was because his messengers would always eat them up themselves. Each night, when he returned home he would be surprised to hear that his mother had been starving all day. He was absolutely disgusted with his herd. Then one day, he decided to leave them all behind and disappeared in the middle of the night along with his dear mother.

It so happened that one day, when the white elephant was feeding he heard loud cries. A forester from benaras had lost his way in the forest and was absolutely terrified. He had come to the area to visit relatives and could not find his way out. On seeing this big white elephant he was even more terrified and ran as fast as he could. The elephant followed him and told him not to be afraid, as all he wanted to do was to help him. He asked the forester why he was crying so bitterly. The forester replied that he was crying because he had been roaming the forest for the past seven days and could not find his way out. The elephant told him not to worry as he knew every inch of this forest and could take him to safety. He then lifted him on to his back and carried him to the edge of the forest from where the forester went on his merry way back to benaras. On reaching the city, he heard that king brahmadutta's personal elephant had just died and the king was looking for a new elephant. His heralds were roaming the city, announcing that any man who had seen or heard of an elephant fit for a king should come forward with the information. The forester was very excited and immediately went up to the king and told him about the white elephant that he had seen on mount candorana. He told him that he had marked the way and would require the help of the elephant trainers in order to catch this fantastic elephant. The king was quite pleased with the information and immediately dispatched a number of soldiers and elephant trainers along with the forester. After travelling for many days, the group reached the lake besides which the elephants resided. They slowly moved down to the edge of the lake and hid behind the bushes. The white elephant was collecting lotus shoots for his mother's meal and could sense the presence of humans. When he looked up, he spotted the forester and realized that it was he who had led the king's men to him.

So he decided to go along with them to benaras and then request the benevolent king to be set free. That night when the white elephant did not return home, his mother was very worried. She had heard all the commotion outside and had guessed that the king's men had taken away her son. She was scared that the king would ride him in to battle and her son would definitely be killed.

Meanwhile her son was led in to the beautiful city of benaras where he was given a grand reception. The whole city was decorated and his own stable was gaily painted and covered with garlands of fragrant flowers. The trainers laid out a feast for their new state elephant who refused to touch a morsel. He did not respond to any kind of stimuli, be it the fragrant flowers or the beautiful and comfortable stable. He just sat there looking completely despondent. The worried trainers went straight to report the situation to their king, as they were scared that the elephant would just waste away without any food or water. The king was extremely concerned when he heard what they had to say and went to the stable himself. He offered the elephant food from the royal table and asked him why he grieved in this manner. He thought that the elephant should be proud and honored that he was chosen as the state elephant and would get the opportunity to serve his king. But the white elephant replied that he would not eat a thing until he met his mother. So the king asked him where his mother was. The elephant replied that she was back home on mount candorana and must be worried and hungry as she was blind and had no one to feed her and take care of her. He was afraid that she would die. The compassionate king was touched by the elephant's story and asked him to return to his blind, old mother and take care of her as he had been doing all along. He set him free in love and kindness.

['Once upon a time there was a burger who had many lives. Each day she would wake up in the burger bar, and patiently wait her turn to be cooked by the chefs, before being served to the customers. While being eaten, she would do everything possible to make herself really delicious, and with the customer\'s final bite she would feel like the lights had gone out and she had simply fallen asleep. The next day the whole process would repeat itself. The little burger could have continued quietly living this way for many years if it hadn\'t been for the fact that, one day, while she was waiting her turn at the cooking range, she heard one of the customers referring to her as "Junk food". And, boy, did this make her angry! She was so furious that she almost spontaneously combusted. From then on she realised that many people used that term about her and her sisters. And after listening closely to any radio or television program about junk food or healthy food, she arrived at a horrifying conclusion: it was true, she was "Junk food". Now she understood why most of her favourite customers were now much fatter than they had been when she first met them, and why those who came most often didn\'t look too well. The burger felt terrible; all this was her fault! So she tried to find some solution, some way they could shake off that terrible name. And then she hit on it. Whenever she saw one of the kids who visited almost daily, she would choose the best place to be chosen, and would wait to be served. Once he was with the child, and the important moment wasn\'t far off - the first bite - the burger would concentrate as much as she could and… nothing happened. The child sank their teeth into the burger and chewed the mouthful just as usual. Then along came another bite, with the burger concentrating as before, but everything happened just as before… several more bites and the burger was about to give up, when she heard the child\'s voice:   -"Blimey, how strange! this burger doesn\'t taste of anything."That was just the start of what turned out to be a perfect plan. The burger convinced all her sisters not to have any flavour whenever they were with a customer that visited too often, in return for being even more tasty when the customer came only rarely. In this way they began to see fewer chubby, unhealthy-looking faces in the restaurant, and many of their old familiar friends started looking much better, while getting to eat much tastier burgers. And these burgers became much more popular from then on, because, everywhere, it\'s more enjoyable to taste something after a while of not having had it.

['Pete hated losing at anything. His parents, teachers, and many others, said he didn\'t know how to lose, but the truth of it was that he couldn\'t stand losing, not even at marbles. It was so great, and he felt so good, when he won, that he never wanted to give up that feeling; not for anything in the world. On top of that, losing made him feel precisely the opposite. It seemed to pete that losing was the worst thing that could happen to anyone. If there was a game pete wasn\'t brilliant at, he simply wouldn\'t play it. But if he was going to win he would take part, even if the game lasted only a minute. And the kind of things he was really good at, like table football, you could hardly stop him playing. A new kid started at pete\'s school, and his name was albert. Albert was a cracking table football player, and it didn\'t take pete and albert long before they challenged each other to a game. Pete prepared for the match with great seriousness. He was concentrated and intense. Albert, on the other hand, seemed not to be taking the thing at all seriously. He walked about the whole time, smiling and cracking jokes about all sorts of things. But on the football table, albert was a real phenomenon. He scored goals again and again, laughing and joking all the time. However, albert was paying so little attention to the match that pete managed to change the scoreboard while his opponent was looking elsewhere, and so pete managed to win by cheating. Pete made a big thing of his win, but it seemed not to matter to albert. - "It\'s been fun. we should play again some other time", said albert. On that day, people at school talked about little else. Pete\'s great victory was on everyone\'s lips. But, that night, pete didn\'t feel so happy. He had won, but even with that there was no trace of the joyful feeling he usually enjoyed so much. What\'s more, albert hadn\'t felt bad about losing. He almost seemed to enjoy it. And, to top it all, the next day pete saw albert playing basketball. He was absolutely hopeless; he lost time after time. But that happy smile never left his face. For several days pete watched the new guy. He was great at some things, terrible at others - to an embarrassing degree - but he enjoyed everything equally. Pete began learning that to enjoy a game you didn\'t have to have a scoreboard; nor did you have to have winning and losing. What you had to do was enjoy the game for its own sake, trying to do well, and enjoying each aspect of it. Finally, pete found himself playing hide and seek, telling a joke while playing table football, and regretting that a particularly fun game he was playing was soon about to end. And without really knowing why, the older kids started commenting amongst themselves, - "Good fun playing with pete, that kid sure isn\'t a sore loser."

['Claire just loved cough mixture. It was very sweet and so, whenever she started catching a cold, she went running to her mother for a dose. And every time she would ask for a bit extra. Her mother often explained to her that you have to take medicine in the correct amounts, but claire wasn\'t convinced. One night, she had a very strange dream. In it she was minuscule - smaller than a mosquito - and she was living inside a child. She and many others there were responsible for taking some little red balls to the other end of a big bridge. There, some musicians would collect the balls and turn them into musical notes. They were really happy to do this, because when each little ball reached its destination, the conductor of the orchestra added the new note to the tune, continuing the beautiful music which was delighting them all. Before long, they began to run out of little red balls, and for a while the music lost its power and its joy. The child they were living in was becoming sick. Fortunately, the child soon took some cough medicine and the little red balls started appearing again. Likewise, the music became more powerful and joyful, as it had been before. Suddenly, a loud alarm bell went off. The child had taken too much cough mixture!

And as she was falling, she heard how the music had stopped forever…clair suddenly woke up, with a fright.

['Once, a man was walking on a mountain when he found an incredible cave. Stored inside were all kinds of treasure and precious stones, and when he saw it, the man concealed the cave entrance and stayed there, guarding it. From that day on, the man would hide all his valuables in the cave, and to avoid anyone suspecting he was rich, he gave up his job, his home, and his friends. He constantly watched the approaches to his cave, wanting no one to find out about it, and fearing thieves, he guarded the cave the whole night through. He was so dedicated to the cave that he hardly ate or drank. Before long, he fell ill. Many days passed, and he got thinner and sicker, losing all his strength, until he was on the point of dying. One day, when he could hardly move at all, he realised that it was his greed which had brought him to this extreme end. He now understood that guarding his treasure had been of no use and no good whatsoever. Just before he died, he decided to share it with others. He crawled into the cave to get a handful of jewels, but discovered, to his horror, that the cave was almost empty. All he could find was a small emerald, which had only a dull sheen to it. The man took it, and left the cave, intending to give it to the first person to come by. Soon a woman approached, and she accepted the emerald with great joy. The man said to her, "I would have given you many more treasures, my dear, but I don\'t know where they went. this is all I have left.""Are you sure there\'s nothing else?" Replied the woman. The man shook his head, and pointed to the cave. Now he could see that there were, indeed, some treasures still there; he saw some gold coins. "Take them with you," The woman took both the emerald and the coins, and went away happy. In a while, an old man came by and asked the man what he was doing there. "What bad luck! just a moment ago I gave a woman the few riches left from the fabulous hoard of treasure I was guarding." "Are you sure there is nothing left?", the old man asked him. The man showed him the cave, and they found a chest filled with jewels and some bags of gold. The man was shocked, and the old man explained to him, "At last! at last someone has freed himself from the spell of this cave. you see, this is the cave of a thousand treasures, and you\'re the first to pass its great test. many are they that have dedicated their lives to this cave, only to end up realising there was nothing here…""And why does this happen?" Said the man, "Why do these treasures appear and disappear?" "My son, this magic cave has as many riches as does your own heart. when someone discovers it, the cave fills with the treasure they bring with them, but later, when they all devoted themselves to guarding the treasure, their hearts begin emptying, and so does the cave. the only way to fill it is by filling your heart with all that is good, as you did by giving that last jewel to the woman. didn\'t you feel better for having done it? that was because the cave was filling up again…"And so, the man understood it was better to share than to keep things to yourself. And, from that day, thanks to the cave and the old man, the man became ever noble and generous.

['Wincey wise was a young lady who worked cleaning the king\'s advisers\' building. She was a very intelligent and studious girl, and wasn\'t going to waste the opportunity of being around these wise men. Even so, after a year there, listening to their meetings through the keyhole, she was worried. The wise men never talked about anything new. They just went on about old matters: when he did this and he learned that. Wincey had been reading all the books the men mentioned, and about all the subjects they discussed. But there came a time when she didn\'t know what to learn next. She had read everything on what the advisers talked about. So wincey started reading about all kinds of other things. Meanwhile, a very long drought had begun - something which had never happened in that land. The wise men proposed solutions, but as it was something that had never happened before, none of their ideas worked. Wincey, who had read all about climate, and seeing that she knew a great deal more than them, dared to interrupt their deliberations to suggest some solutions. The advisers ignored her; they said she was just a girl, that they were the experts, and not to bother them again. Wincey felt so saddened and offended that she gave up her job there, went home, and spent several days holed up in her attic. When she left she was pushing a trolley, and she pushed it straight to the palace. She showed the king her invention: a strange contraption with lots of buttons and a huge tuba sticking out the top. "This is the cloudsqueezer," Said wincey, "It will put an end to the drought.""Hmm," Said the king, looking doubtful, "Does it really work?" Wincey bent over the machine, whispered a few words into it, and the words were transformed into strange deep noises, which came out of the tuba, like a speaker. Soon, a light shower began falling outside. It stopped as suddenly as it had started. "Did you cast a spell?" Said the king, "Are you some kind of witch?""You what?" Answered wincey, "It\'s just a bit of science." The king seemed to approve, and he called for his advisers to come and see the new invention. Wincey gave another demonstration. On seeing the rain fall, the advisers launched into a great scholarly debate. Was the effect based on atmospheric turbulence? Was it a product of lunar reflectivity? And so many other equally ignorant theories that wincey couldn\'t help but chuckle to herself. While they had been theorising, the rain outside just got harder and harder. It ended up raining heavier than anyone had ever seen. The advisers kept talking, and it rained all the harder. So much so, that the king had to tell wincey to disconnect the machine. She turned off the cloudsqueezer, and the rain stopped. In front of astonished faces, she explained. "The cloudsqueezer is just a translator. it translates and amplifies words so that the clouds can understand them." "So, how come it starts to rain?" Asked the king. "Ahh, that\'s because the clouds have a good sense of humour. every time they hear a bit of foolishness they cry with laughter!"Everyone looked accusingly at the king\'s advisers, and the wise men could do nothing but blush like tomatoes, in shame. That experience turned out of great use to the king. Not only did the drought come to an end, but, from that day on, they always kept the cloudsqueezer switched on. To avoid being shamed by the clouds tears of laughter, the people of that land soon learned to study what they could, and to keep quiet on themes about which they were ignorant.

['Very interesting story once a man used to serve his old master, day and night. He would make food, bring water from well, massage his master\'s feet and do all things for his master. Old master used to say, "Why are you wasting your time?"Old master knew that there must be some desire, for which that man is serving him. Master used to ask him what he wants. One day man said, "I am serving you because I want to learn miracle from you, even if it\'s just one miracle."Old master replied, "But I don\'t know any miracle. you have unnecessarily wasted your time. you should find someone else, who knows miracle."Man replied, "I have been told that you always deny that you know any miracle but I have seen that you go on continuously performing miracles.I have been told, \'don\'t listen and go on serving him. one day master will tell you secret but only when he finds you ripe.\'perhaps am not ripe yet, not ready for your miracle that\'s why you are not telling me."Saying this man continued with his work. Few days passed by, old man saw that man was unnecessarily working. One day, old master called him and said, "It seems that you will not leave unless I tell you the secret."Man replied, "Yes. I will not leave without miracle."Old man said, "Ok then I will tell you. here is the mantra using which miracles can be performed.what you have to do is first take bath, change your clothes to fresh clothes, close your door, sit alone and repeat this small mantra and repeat it five time, just five times. then you will be able to do any miracles you want to do."Listening to this man got happy. He took mantra, didn\'t even show any gratitude and simple rushed down the steps of temple. When man was in middle, old master shouted, "Wait, I have forgotten one thing. while you repeat this mantra remember one thing - don\'t think of any monkey."Man was puzzled and said, "Why should I think of monkey? I have never thought about it my whole life."Old master smiled and said, "That\'s ok. just remember that. not to think of monkey at all. if monkey comes in, you have to repeat mantra five times again."Man replied, "But why should monkey come?"Old master said, "I don\'t know. I just told you secret that has been told to me by my master."Man couldn\'t even get down stairs before he started thinking about monkeys. He thought to himself, "I haven\'t even started reciting mantra yet and monkeys are coming."Man reached home, with his mind crowded with monkeys. Wherever he looked he could see only monkey. Man thought, "Master is such an idiot. if he knew that monkey was trouble, he shouldn\'t have mentioned it. no elephant or lion or any other animal is coming to mind and monkey are not leaving."Man had bath, changed to fresh clothes and sat alone in his room which his eyes closed but it was useless. Monkeys were nudging him, they were all around him. Wherever he looked, he would see monkeys even in face of his wife and father. Man was going mad. Five times was too much, he wasn\'t even to complete mantra even once without thinking about monkey. By morning he was almost mad. He went back to old master and returned mantra and told him all about he had been thinking about and happening to him since he left. Master said, "What can I do? that monkey comes with the mantra. without the monkey the mantra is useless. unless you can avoid monkeys you cannot perform miracles."Man replied, "Please take your mantra, I don\'t want it and relieve me of monkeys."Old master said, "Once you have left mantra with me they will not come."Man left and he was surprised that now there were no monkeys. He reached home and everything went back to normal. He felt strange. He took bath and thought, "Although I have returned written mantra but because I tried to chant it yesterday many time, I remember it. there is no harm to try it now. now I can repeat it."Moment he started mantra, monkey started to appear. Just then man dropped the whole idea. If you try to stop a thought, you cannot. On contrary, the very effort to stop it gives it energy, the very effort to avoid it becomes attention.

As soon as he jumped he got trapped inside well and couldn\'t ever came out and valley was rid of evil lion. ', 'Wisdom is stronger than physical strength. ', 19]

['Everyone knows that the history of our planet changed forever some time after the beijing olympic games. The world\'s coasts and seas filled up with a very dangerous and polluting species of creature, which looked like a squid, but was called a "Squidge". The squidges were everywhere, and impossible to catch. But the worst aspect of it was that they were filling up the seas with oil, tins, paper, and all kinds of rubbish. It was a terrible situation; the whole planet was quickly contaminated, and advanced investigation teams and hunting expeditions were set up to try to deal with this new plague. But no one could even get close to catching a squidge. Finally, the first person to manage it was a boy called caesar tiddler. Caesar lived in a small fishing village, and when he held up his squidge at a press conference, he became the most famous boy in the world. That small fishing village was overrun by scientists and government investigators, who came from all over the planet to study the species. Everything was prepared for a post mortem to be done on the squidge, an operation that would be watched on live television around the world. So imagine the amazement when, on cutting the squidge open, a tiny space ship the size of a shoe was found inside, and inside that space ship were some martians. Now, these martians turned out to be quite charming, amusing, and clever little chaps. Before long, they were busy talking to governments, who were all very angry at the way the martians had been messing up the planet. The governments expected some kind of explanation for the martians having behaved in such an uncivilised fashion…   -"We came from a planet that was going to be destroyed," The martians began to explain. -"We liked the earth so much that we spent many days spying on how you human beings behave. we thought that would help us to blend in if we came here, and it would help us all get along happily together. that\'s why, after seeing you dump tins, paper, and oil, we invented some expensive machines to do just that. we hid them inside the disguise of a squid, and we tried to live happily there, in peace. are you all happy? can we stay here? finallllyyyyy?"The martian squidge-men waited for an answer. But no one uttered a word. Everyone, including the billions watching on tv, were red with embarrassment, remembering the last time they had thrown away a piece of paper, or their car had leaked some oil on the road.

["This is the incredible tale of a very odd boy. He always wanted what wasn't his: his friends' toys, his cousins' clothes, his parents' books…he ended up being so envious that even the hairs on his head were given to jealousy. One day, it just so happened that a hair on the crown of his head woke up completely green. Now, when the other hairs saw this they became so hugely envious that they too ended up turning green. The next day, a hair near his hairline was stained by something blue. Seeing this, again all the other hairs ended up blue. So, day after day, the boy's hair would completely change colour, driven by the boundless envy his hairs felt. Everyone loved the boy's colourful and ever-changing hair; except the boy himself. He always wanted what other people had, so, of course, he wanted to have hair just like the others had. One day, this angered him so much that he furiously pulled at his hair. One rather thin hair couldn't endure all the pulling, and it let go; falling to the floor with quite a nice smooth flight. Of course, the other hairs saw this, felt envious, and they all let go too. Within a minute the boy was as bald as an egg, and the look of surprise on his face seemed like a bad joke. After many tears and tantrums, the boy understood how all this had happened, and how it had all been a natural consequence of his envy. He decided that, from then on, he would try to enjoy what he had, without becoming obsessed by what others had. Trying to put this into practice he started by making the most of his smooth, shiny, hairless head. He turned it into his own private canvas. From that day on, he took to painting beautiful, colourful scenes on his bald head. People enjoyed these so much that the boy finally developed into one of the world's best - and certainly the world's most original - artists.

One day, a young wizard was passing by the village and saw leo being made fun of. When the other boys left, the wizard went over to leo and gave him a beautiful lion\'s tail, along with a small tie that allowed leo to hang the lion\'s tail from his belt. -"It\'s a magic tail. when the person wearing it acts bravely, he or she will turn into a ferocious lion."Having seen the young wizard\'s powers some days earlier during his act, leo didn\'t doubt his words, and from that time on he wore the lion\'s tail hanging from his belt, hoping that the horrible kids would turn up so he could teach them a good lesson.

['In the dark lands of the witches and the trolls, there lived, a long time ago, the most terrible dragon that had ever existed. His magic powers enabled him to take on cloud form, so he could move as fast as the wind. He could make himself as light as a feather, and take any form, from a simple lamb to a fierce ogre. And, being a cloud dragon, he was the only creature capable of firing not only flames from his mouth, but also brilliant lightning bolts. The cloud dragon would attack towns and villages just for pleasure, for the simple fact of hearing people\'s cries at his terrible appearances. But he only really found true fun when the humans would send one of their knights and heroes to try to kill him. On those occasions he would entertain himself by making interminable rains fall on their armour, or sending little lightning bolts that would scorch the knights and make all their hair stand up. Then he would transform himself into a dense fog, and, the knight, unable to see anything around himself, wasn\'t even aware that the cloud he was in was rising and starting to fly. And after playing with the knight in the air for a good while, by which point the knight would be completely dizzy, the dragon would return to his natural form, leaving the poor hero floating in mid-air. Then he wouldn\'t be able to stop laughing, his flames of laughter licking at the knight as he fell at a great velocity into the mountain snows where, hurt, frozen and singed, the abandoned knight would have to search for the long route home. Only young yela, the king\'s youngest son, who had long been famous for his constant naughtiness, felt some kind of sympathy for the dragon. Something inside told him that there couldn\'t be anyone who was really as bad as that and, as had happened to him from an early age, the dragon would be able to learn to behave well. So, when he went in search of the dragon, he did so without shield or armour, totally unarmed, ready to find out what it was that made the dragon behave as he did. As soon as the dragon saw the young prince coming, he began his repertoire of tricks and teasing. Yela found his tricks were really unique, even amusing, and he dared to enjoy those moments spent with the dragon. When yela was finally dropped into the snow, he got up, singed and hurt, but smiling, and he shouted:    -"Come on! again! yee-haaa!"The cloud dragon was surprised, but it seemed like he had been waiting for that for centuries, since he didn\'t hesitate to repeat his tricks and even add some more, for the young prince\'s enjoyment. The dragon was having such fun that he began taking special care with his playmate, to the point that, when they stopped to rest a while, they did it together, smiling, like two good friends. Yela not only carried on letting the dragon play with him. The prince himself started playing practical jokes, putting on shows, and being naughty, and together they created many new tricks. Finally, yela got to know the dragon\'s family, only to learn that, despite being hundreds of years old, the dragon was no more than a child; an enormous kid wanting to be naughty and have fun. And so, the prince was able to return to his kingdom on a great cloud in the shape of a dragon, amid the joy and admiration of all. And with the help of children, comedians, actors and buffoons they managed to bring such joy to the young dragon\'s life that never again did he feel the need to harm anyone for entertainment. And as payment for all the fun the dragon provided rain, shade and fire to the kingdom whenever it was needed. ', 'We all have reasons for behaving as we do.

['Mr. Phillips was just getting ready to leave his office and he remembered that his wife had asked him to bring 1kg of bananas. When he stepped out, he saw an ill-looking old lady across the road. She was selling fresh bananas on the street. Mr. Phillips usually buys bananas from a grocery shop few blocks away from his office but since he was in hurry to reach home today, he thought about buying them from across the road only. He went to the old lady and asked her the price. She quoted $7 per 1kg. He told, "But the store where I usually buy from gives them for $5 per 1kg, can you not give me for the same price?" The old lady told, "No sir, I can not afford to match that price. I can sell them to you at $6 per 1kg. that\'s best I can afford to give you for." Mr. Phillips told her, "Nevermind". He left in his car towards the usual grocery shop. He went inside and picked up a good bunch of bananas. He went to the cashier to pay for them but he was surprised when the cashier told him that price per 1kg is $10. He told the cashier, "I have been buying bananas from here only for some years and this is a steep price increase, can\'t you offer me a better deal for being a loyal customer?" The manager overheard him and came there. He told mr. Phillips, "Sorry sir but our prices are fixed, we do not bargain." Mr. Phillips felt little bad with that flat attitude. He thought for a second and put those bananas back. He went back to the old lady. She recognized him instantly and told him, "Sir, I can\'t match that price, I won\'t be able to earn any profit." Mr. Phillips told her, "Don\'t worry about the price, I will pay you $10 per kg! now, give me 2kg." The old lady got very happy, she packed 2kgs of bananas and said, "I can\'t take $10 but I will take $7 per kg. I appreciate your kindness." She also told him, "My husband used to own a small fruit shop but he got very sick. we have no child or any relatives who could support us. we had to sell his shop to cover his medical bills but he could not survive." Tears were flowing from her eyes. She said, "But now to support myself I am trying to sell what I can afford to buy and sell, so I can survive for what\'s left of my life."Mr. Phillips told her, "Do not worry, you are doing good and from tomorrow on, I will only buy bananas from you." \xa0he pulled out his wallet and gave her $100 extra and said, "Take this, bring more different fruits to sell tomorrow, consider this an advance payment for fruits I will be buying from you. you can earn more if you have more choices of fruits to sell." The old lady thanked him. Later, he recommended many of his colleagues to buy fruits from the lady which they did. And with the support from mr. Phillips and many other buyers, she made a better living. ', 'Often we choose to go in big malls or big grocery shops for a shopping. We always pay the fixed price without bargaining. That is fine as we all have choices and people who run their business have their liabilities too.

['As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at any time can break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not. He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. "Well," Trainer said, "When they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it\'s enough to hold them. as they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. they believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free."The man was amazed.

['There was once a kangaroo who became an athletics champion. However, with this success he became arrogant and nasty, and he spent a lot of time making fun of others. His favourite target was a little penguin whose walk was so slow and clumsy that it often prevented him from even finishing the race. One day the fox, who organised the races, let everyone know that his favourite for the next race was the poor penguin. Everyone thought it was a joke, but still the big-headed kangaroo got very angry, and he ridiculed the penguin even more than usual. The penguin did not even want to take part in the race, but it was a tradition that everyone must do so. On the day of the race, he approached the starting line in a group which was following the fox. The fox led them up the mountain, while everyone made fun of the penguin, commenting on whether he would roll down the mountain or just slide down on his fat belly. But when they reached the top they all shut up. The top of the mountain turned out to be a crater that had filled with water, making it into a lake. At this point, the fox gave the starting signal, saying: "First to the other side wins". The penguin, excited, waddled clumsily to the water\'s edge. Once he was in the water, though, his speed was unbeatable, and he won the race by a long distance. Meanwhile, the kangaroo barely managed to reach the other side; tearful, humiliated, and half drowned. And although it seemed like the penguin was waiting to make fun of the kangaroo, the penguin had learned a lot from his suffering, and instead of ridiculing the kangaroo, he offered to teach him how to swim. For the rest of the day the animals enjoyed themselves, playing in the lake. But the one who enjoyed himself the most was the fox, who, with his cleverness, had managed to bring the kangaroo down a peg or two.

['There once was a daddy who was in such a hurry to finish the stories that he told his children every night that he began to leave out some of the words. Taking out words here and there, he was able to finish the stories a little quicker. However, this still didn\'t seem enough, so he kept shortening them more and more until, one day, he cut out the most important words of a tale: "The end". That night he went to bed peacefully but he woke up feeling rather strange. He got up and when he looked in the mirror he realised that he was wearing a big pirate hat and a black eye-patch and had an enormous red beard with white spots! There was no doubt in his mind: he had been transformed into flamenco beard, the notorious pirate captain from his tales. Worried, he ran to his children\'s bedrooms. As he opened the door, a great wall of water came crashing down on him and he soon found himself swimming in the middle of the sea. He wasn\'t alone, however. He was being chased by hungry sharks which had not eaten for weeks. Flamenco beard prepared himself to fight, grabbing the butter knife that he always kept hidden under his hat. Just as he was about to lunge at the first shark, he felt himself being lifted into the air and then dropped onto the deck of a giant pirate ship. "That was close, captain" - said a pirate sailor who was the spitting image of his eldest son. "The captain could\'ve dealt with those clumsy sharks!" Shouted a couple of cabin boys who were so similar flamenco beard could have sworn they were his twins. There was no time to lose. The captain was told that the queen had been kidnapped and there would be a great reward for whoever rescued her safe and sound. Without a second thought, they set sail to the island of the last cannibal, the favourite spot for all baddies wishing to hide kidnapped queens. They were at full sail when a big, dark storm started to form and, as fate would have it, a bolt of lightning struck the mast of the ship, triggering a massive fire. They were so busy putting out the fire that they didn\'t realise that an enormous wave had hurled the ship onto the reefs around the island with so much force that the captain and his sailors were sent flying into the air. When the captain woke up, he found himself tied to a big tree trunk. His crew of pirates was tied up next to him. They were in the heart of the island\'s volcano, the place chosen by the cannibals for their sacrifices and rituals. However, they were not the ones who were going to be eaten. Everything had been put in place to sacrifice a beautiful woman with a crown, who had to be the queen. The cannibals started their chants. How annoying, they always did everything while singing. Then the captain had an idea. With a loud voice, he began to sing pirate songs and all the crew joined in singing at the top of their voices. The cannibals tried to sing louder and, even though there were more of them, they couldn\'t sing louder than the captain and his men. Without their chants, they couldn\'t begin the feast so, red in the face with anger, they decided to switch the captain for the queen. Now it was the captain who was hanging above a big pot, about to be cooked. He could feel the burning of the pepper and smell the sauce, and he became so hot that he no longer had the strength to sing. His men were silenced also by the big dollops of chocolate ice cream they were eating with relish. How did those savages know that chocolate ice cream was his crew\'s weakness? Just then he saw the queen smile, a crooked smile that only withered flower possessed. Clearly, it had all been a trap, set by the fearsome woman pirate captain - once his greatest companion but was now his biggest rival - to capture flamenco beard and his men. Surrounded by cannibals and grimacing at the pain of the first bite, the captain accepted defeat. "You win, withered flower. this is the end."On saying that last word, everything disappeared and the daddy found himself in bed, still scared and sweaty. Lying next to him, wearing the same crooked smile as withered flower, his wife gave him a kiss and said: "Next time you shorten the stories you tell the children, you\'ll have me to deal with in the cave of madness."The daddy lay deep in reflection throughout the night. It had been great fun to be part of the stories but he was also so terrified that he vowed never to cut even a single word from his children\'s stories again.

["Once upon a time there were four seeds who were good friends of each other. Taken up by the wind they finally landed in a jungle clearing. There they remained, hidden on the ground, hoping they would be able to grow up and become beautiful trees. But when the first seed began germinating, they realised it wouldn't be such an easy task. In that clearing there lived a group of monkeys, and the smallest monkeys would amuse themselves by throwing bananas at any plant they noticed was starting to grow. Using this game, the monkeys learnt how to throw bananas and they also kept the clearing free of vegetation. They threw so many bananas at that first seed that it was almost split in two. And when it told the other seeds what happened, they all agreed it would be better to wait for that group of monkeys to move on, before they attempted to grow. Well, they all thought that, apart from one, who thought she should at least attempt it. And when she tried she was pelted with bananas, and was left folded over in two. The other seeds got together and asked her to stop trying, but that little seed was completely determined to become a tree, and time and again she would try and try. On each new occasion the little monkeys had slightly improved their aim, and so the little seed ended up doubled over yet again. But the seed didn't give up. Every time they pelted her with bananas, she tried even harder, despite her friends begging her to stop, and telling her to wait until the monkeys left. And so, for days, weeks and months the little plant was attacked by the monkeys, and she always ended stooped and doubled over.

But her shouts seemed like whispers compared to those of her daughter, little squeals screecher. People said that she had made all the cockroaches and creatures of the village flee with just a single shriek. I don\'t think they were exaggerating, because the truth is that no one could possibly get a moment\'s rest until squeals was asleep. She asked for everything at the top of her lungs. And then there was the daddy, mr. Silent screecher, a magnificent crackpot inventor who hadn\'t created anything in years. Well, what would you expect with all the noise? That\'s why he invented the gobbling-mosquitoes: amazing mosquitoes that were scientifically modified to swallow people\'s screams. In fact, they did their job so well that no one even noticed the day he invented them because they devoured all his shouts of joy and it was as if nothing had happened. Of course, shouts are just made of air, which doesn\'t really fill you up, so it wasn\'t long until the mosquitoes went off in search of food. They didn\'t have to travel far because just one floor below they found mouthy and squeals, whose shouts were enough to fill them up and turn them into big fat flies. The mosquitoes fought each other to gobble up the shouts even before they came out of their mouths and so, for days, no one heard mouthy and squeals say a single word. When the people of the village saw them, it looked like they were shouting furiously with a cloud of mosquitoes around their heads. "Poor little things" The people thought, "They\'ve finally lost their voices". "Well, it\'s a break for all of us. no one could possibly put up with all their screaming". But their throats were not the problem. Squeals herself discovered this when she started to grow weak after several days without eating. No one knew she was hungry because she asked for food with such loud screams that the gobbling-mosquitoes that swallowed them up died of indigestion! "I\'m hungry" She said very softly, when she had no energy left. "Wow, what a beautiful voice you have!" Said her neighbour, as she made her a sandwich, "I\'ve never heard you speak before!" Feeling better, squeals discovered that when she spoke more quietly, the words came out of her mouth beautifully. People admired her lovely voice and everyone was so much nicer to her. Up until then, people only paid attention to her to keep her quiet. When she told her mummy, she too stopped screaming and they both realised that life could be much happier and quieter. Thanks to the new quietness, mr. Silent screecher was even able to start an outstanding collection of inventions that made him famous all over the world. What happened to the gobbling-mosquitoes? Well, when squeals and mouthy stopped shouting, the mosquitoes became smaller and smaller until they were almost invisible. Just when they were about to disappear altogether, they realised that the world was full of howling humans and that they would never go hungry again.

All the animals had to make a great effort to rest during the day, so that they could play at night. But they so wanted to cheer the sun up that all the animals managed it. Soon the sun and with it, happiness, returned to the forest and to the rest of the world. N. B. This story is not from one unique author. It is one of the wonderful tales created by a group from the 'creative story workshop', which I ran at tajamar college in madrid.

['There was once a young man who liked puppets so much that he became an apprentice to a master puppet-maker. Sadly, the young man was very clumsy, and his teacher and the other apprentices were always telling him he had no ability when it came to making puppets, and that he would never amount to anything. Even so, he enjoyed it so much that he worked day after day to improve. Despite his efforts, they would always find something wrong with the puppets he had made, and they ended up throwing him out of the workshop. He wasn\'t going to give up, so the young man decided that from then on he would spend all his time making just one kind of puppet. On he went, and whenever he found a fault in his puppet he would abandon it and start again right from square one. The years passed, and with each new attempt his puppet became a little bit better. By now, his puppet was much better than anything his old fellow apprentices could make, but he kept making improvements, seeking perfection. Living like that, the man wasn\'t making any money, and many people laughed at how poor he was. By the time he was an old man, his puppet was truly wonderful. So much so, that finally one day, after so many years of work, he finished work on his puppet, and said: "I can\'t find anything wrong with it. this time it is perfect", and for the first time in all those years, instead of abandoning his puppet, he put it up on the shelf, feeling truly satisfied and happy. And the rest is history. That perfect puppet came to life, had a thousand adventures, and gave that old man - whose name was geppetto - more joy than any other famous puppet-maker ever got from any of their creations.

['One day, in the jungle, a set of bathroom scales appeared. The animals played with it for quite some time until a parrot who had escaped from the zoo explained to them how it worked. All the animals took turns to weigh themselves. At first this was a big game; every day each animal would see how much weight they had gained or lost. However, before long, many animals began to obsess about their weight. The first thing they would do each day would be to run to the scales, weigh themselves, and spend the rest of the day with a grumpy expression on their faces. This because, no matter what the scales said, the animals always weighed the same, in other words: "More than they wanted to". As the months passed, the scales began to suffer the animals\' disapproval. The scales were regularly kicked, or given poisonous looks. One day, the scales decided that from the following morning things would have to change. That morning, the first to run to weigh itself was the zebra. However, as soon as it stepped onto the scales, the scales began tickling the zebra\'s hooves. Soon the scales found just the right spot, and the zebra couldn\'t stop giggling. This was so much fun for the zebra that from that day on it no longer worried about its weight, and off it went to happily eat its breakfast for the first time in ages. The same happened to whoever went to weigh themselves that day… so that, before long, no one was worried any longer about their weight. Rather, they all commented on how much fun the scales and its tickling were. As the months and the years passed, the scales stopped reading weight and began reading good humour and optimism instead. Soon everyone happily discovered that this was a much better indicator of beauty and a person\'s value. Finally, in the jungle everyone forgot about that antiquated and old-fashioned measurement known as the kilo.

['In a village, lived two very good friends one was mintu whose age was 5 and other was shinu whose age was 10. They used to do everything together like playing, sleeping, eating. Younger one was smarter and lean where as elder one was stronger and bulky. One day there were playing and running behind each other, they entered forest near village.

['There were once two young wizard apprentices called iplant and ieat, who trained for years to go and charge their wands in the mysterious fountain of magic. When they were finally ready, they travelled by sea to the island of a thousand deserts, crossed its endless sand dunes, climbed the great rock mountain and finally found the fountain. But the fountain was dry. So dry that they could only fill their wands with a tiny drop of magic. And when the magic of the fountain was drained, the island was transformed into an immense desert that no one could cross. Only two small oases remained and, to give themselves the best chance at survival, iplant and ieat decided to go their separate ways, each to their own tiny oasis. Life then became very hard for both of them. Although the oasis provided them with plenty of water, their only food were the dates from the few palm trees that had grown at the water\'s edge. Although they waved their wands in an attempt to obtain food, they had so little magic that nothing ever happened. Several weeks later, however, ieat waved his wand and a huge, tasty tomato appeared before him. "Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today."And that day was ieat\'s best since he had gone to live in the oasis. A few days later, something similar happened to iplant, when his wand produced a small potato. "Lucky me! if I plant the potato and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days."That day, iplant was just as hungry as before but he also had to work to prepare the soil and plant the potato. Sometime later the wand gave ieat a chubby songbird. "Lucky me! if I eat it now, it will make me happy today." The bird tasted so good that the day turned out to be his best in the oasis. Around that time also, iplant\'s wand gave him a skinny songbird. "Lucky me! if I feed the bird and take care of it, it will make me happy for many days."For many days after that, iplant shared the little food he had with the bird, to get the bird to return and wake him up every morning with beautiful songs. Every now and again, the two wizards received new little gifts from their wands. Ieat used them at once to enjoy a special day, while iplant put up with hunger and tiredness to turn each gift into something that might be useful in future. That way, it didn\'t take him long to grow a small garden with fruit, which he shared with more and more animals who provided him with assistance, food and company. Eventually he felt so happy and comfortable, and had so many things, that he finally dared to go out and find ieat to try and cross the desert and escape. However, ieat wanted nothing to do with him. Hearing how iplant had achieved so much and thinking that he could have done the same, he was filled with anger and jealousy. Convinced that everything was because of the little magic in his own wand, he switched it with iplant\'s when he wasn\'t looking. Impatient to try his new wand, he ordered his old friend to leave. But the wand had even less magic than the one he already had, and the jealous and impatient magician was stuck in his oasis for years and years, unable to escape. Iplant left ieat\'s oasis determined to cross the desert. He had only been travelling for a few hours when a strong gust wind dragged his friend, the little bird, away. The wizard ran after him to save him, but the wind turned into a tornado that lifted the little bird, the wizard and all his things, up into the air. They flew and flew for so many hours that they crossed the desert and then crossed the sea. Finally, the wind dropped and iplant landed softly in a peaceful green valley, next to a beautiful fountain. The bird then took iplant\'s wand in his beak and carried it to the fountain. The young wizard felt the wand and himself fill with the purest magic and the deepest wisdom. He realised that this was the true fountain of magic and that the bird was its faithful guardian, entrusted with the job of saving such great powers for wizards who had sufficient wisdom, patience and willpower to achieve big things with just a tiny drop of magic.

['The fire-breathing dragon roared, spitting fire everywhere. A small armadillo scurried away with its tail on fire. The dragon, having vanquished it\'s enemy, curled up inside its wings. "At last." It murmured. A drop of fire dripped from its red eyes. "I am alone. all alone…" It stood up and roared. Mouse awoke with a start. Another poor animal defeated by the dragon. He thought when he heard the familiar roar of victory. When will this stop? Then, he got an idea. All of the other animals who have entered have been big and strong. What they need is a small, fast spy to get in and out and bring them information! The next day, mouse talked to the king of animalville. "Sir, I believe that I can do it." The king stared at him with his bald eagle eyes. "You?" "I\'ll gather information. and then we can plan an attack. since I\'m so small, I can get in for long enough to find out what its weaknesses are, and it won\'t even see me." Bald eagle looked up. "That might work. but if it sees you, you\'re literally burnt toast!" Mouse looked at the cave. He glanced back at the town behind him. This might be the only time I ever see it again. He tried to swallow the large lump in his throat and plunged in. For hours, he saw nothing but darkness. Then, an orangey glow began to fill the tunnel. Soon, mouse burst into a large chamber filled with piles of… tissues? Mouse was perplexed. I thought dragons horded gold, not kleenexes. He looked around. Where is the dragon, anyways? Then, he heard a sound almost like… crying? Something was seriously off here. He climbed up one of the kleenex mounds and gazed upon the mountains of tissues. He saw the gigantic red dragon huddled amongst them, blowing her nose. Tears of flame were streaming down her face. "Why?" She sobbed. "Why won\'t anybody be my friend?" She blew her nose again and tossed the ashes into another pile. "Everybody who comes in here tries to hurt me. why?"Mouse decided to go down there. He slid down the pile of kleenexes. "I don\'t want to hurt you!" He said. The dragon\'s eyes widened. "Who\'s there?" She roared. "P-please don\'t come closer!" She squinted. Mouse stood right in front of her. When she saw him, she jumped. "Please don\'t hurt me!" She cried. Then she realized what she was looking at. "Hey, you can\'t hurt me. you\'re too small!" Mouse waved. "Hi there! I\'m mouse! nice to meet you.""I think I know why nobody is your friend." Mouse said. "Really?" Dragon\'s eyes filled with hope. "Why?" She lifted him up to her level with her claw. "Woah!" Cried mouse. "This is fun!" He brushed off his fur and looked dragon straight in the eye. "Nobody is your friend because you attack them." He said. Dragon looked puzzled. "But they attack me." She said. "Only because they are afraid of you. I now know that you only fry us because you\'re afraid of us." He made hand gestures as he talked. "Let me tell you about the golden rule." He said. "What\'s the golden rule?" Dragon said. An expression of understanding passed over dragon\'s face. "So, if I want people to like me, I have to stop breathing fire at them."Then one solitary tear of fire dripped from her eye. "But it\'s too late. everyone is so afraid of me that they won\'t give me another chance. I\'m going to be friendless forever!" She started bawling her eyes out. Mouse tapped his finger on his chin and then snapped them. "I wouldn\'t be so sure about that!" Bald eagle relaxed, feet kicked up in a comfy recliner in his three-tree castle, watching the crowds gather to see if mouse would make it out. I sure hope mouse makes it! He thought. He took a sip of coffee and walked into the kitchen. As he microwaved some wonderfully delicious salmon casserole, he heard pounding on his tree. He walked over. His assistant, golden eagle, stood there, eyes wide. "Sir, you have got to see this!" Bald eagle ran out onto the balcony. The fire dragon was flying towards his tree-castle! It landed next to his tree. And mouse stood on its back! "How\'s this for a battle plan?" Mouse yelled. "Yes!" Bald eagle cried. "Good job, my friend!"The fire dragon and the citizens lived happily ever after. ', 'Treat others how you would like to be treated. ', 21]

['Johnny the lizard lived between some rocks out in the country. Like all lizards he loved to quietly sunbathe, laid out on some flat stone. He felt so relaxed doing so, that more than once he had fallen asleep, and that\'s exactly what happened on the day he lost his tail: some kids caught him, and johnny could only escape by losing his tail and running to hide. Shocked and frightened, he listened to how the children laughed at seeing his tail continue moving about, even though it was no longer attached to his body. After a while they threw the tail away. When the children had gone, johnny started looking everywhere for his tail, wanting to reattach it to its rightful place. However, the countryside was very big, and as much as he searched for it, johnny could find no sign of his tail. He left everything else in his life, devoting himself to the search. He forgot about his home, his possessions, his friends. Days and months passed, and johnny kept looking, asking everyone he met whether they had seen his tail. One day, someone he asked surprisedly replied, -"Why do you need two tails?" Johnny turned and saw that after so much time spent searching he had grown a new tail. What\'s more, his new tail looked stronger and better than his old tail. Seeing this, he realised how silly it had been to dedicate so much time to a problem for which there was no solution. Johnny turned back and headed for home. On his way home he found his old tail at the side of the way. It was dry and dusty, and looked really bad. However, johnny, having spent so much time looking for it, was happy to find it, and he picked it up and resumed his journey. Soon he met a frog. The frog, surprised, asked johnny:   -"Why are you carrying such a horrible old tail when you already have such a lovely tail of your own?" -"Because I spent months looking for it," Replied johnny. -"You really spent months looking for something so ugly and dirty?" Said the frog. -"Well,"Johnny explained, -"Previously it wasn\'t as ugly as this…" -"Hmm, but now it is, wouldn\'t you agree?… how strange you lizards are!" Said the frog before jumping off into the distance. The frog was right. Johnny still thought of his tail as though it was the same tail he used to have, but in reality it was now disgusting.

["In a land far away, once upon a time there was great poverty: only the rich could manage without great problems. Three of those rich men, and their servants, were traveling on the same road, in a convoy, when they came to a very poor village. Seeing this poverty provoked different reactions in all three rich men. The first couldn't stand to see it, so he took all the gold and jewels from his wagons and shared them out among the villagers. He wished them all the best of luck, and he left. The second rich man, seeing the desperate situation, stopped for a short time, and gave the villagers all his food and drink, since he could see that money would be of little use to them. He made sure that each villager received their fair share and would have enough food to last for some time. Then, he left. The third rich man, on seeing such poverty, speeded up and traveled straight through the village without stopping. The two other rich men saw this from a distance, and commented with each other how the third rich man lacked decency and compassion. It was good that they had been there to help the poor villagers…however, three days later, they met the third rich man who was traveling in the opposite direction. He was still traveling quickly, but his wagons, instead of the gold and valuables they had been carrying, were now full of farming implements, tools, and sacks of seeds and grain. He was heading to the poor village to help them out of poverty. This happened a long, long time ago, but we can see the very same thing happening today too.

To them it doesn't matter what the other kinds of generous people think of them. Nor do they give in a showy way.

['The mokoko tribe lived on the wrong side of the island of two faces. The two sides, separated by a great cliff, were like night and day. The good side was watered by rivers and was filled with trees, flowers, birds and easy and abundant food, while on the wrong side there was hardly any water or plants, and wild beasts crowded together. The mokoko had the misfortune of having always lived there, with no way to cross to the other side. Their life was hard and difficult: they hardly had food and drink for everyone and they lived in permanent terror of the beasts, who would regularly come and eat some tribe member. Legend told that some of their ancestors had been able to cross with just the help of a small pole, but for many years not a single tree had grown that would be strong enough to make such a pole, so few mokoko believed this was possible, and they had become accustomed and resigned to their difficult, resigned life, suffering hunger and dreaming of not ending up as some peckish beast\'s dinner. But nature had it that, precisely along the edge of the cliff separating the two sides of the island, a skinny but strong tree grew, with which they could build two poles. The feeling of anticipation was enormous and there was no doubt among the tribe as to whom they would choose to use the poles: the great chief and the witch doctor. But when the two of them were given their opportunity to make the jump, they felt so afraid that they didn\'t dared to: they thought that the pole could break, or it would not be long enough, or that something would go wrong during the jump … and they put so much energy into these thoughts that the resulting fear caused them to give in. And when they saw that this could lead them to being teased and taunted, they decided to invent some old stories and legends about failed jumps to the other side. And they told so many of these tales and they spread so much that there was no mokoko who did not know how reckless and foolish you would have to be to even attempt the jump. And there lay the poles, available to anyone wanting to use them, but abandoned by all, because taking up one of these poles had become, by dint of repetition, the most unbecoming thing a mokoko could do. It was a betrayal of the values of suffering and resistance which so  distinguished the tribe. But into that tribe were born naru and ariki, a pair of young hearts truly wanting a different life and, encouraged by the strength of their love, one day decided to take up the poles. Nobody stopped them, but everyone did try to discourage them, trying to convincing them of the dangers of jumping, using a thousand explanations. -"And what if what they say is true?" Wondered the young naru. -"Don\'t\' worry. why do the talk so much about a leap they\'ve never done? I too am a bit scared, but it doesn\'t look so difficult," Replied ariki, ever determined. -"But if it goes wrong, it would be a terrible end," Continued naru, undecided. -"Perhaps the jump will go badly, and perhaps not. but staying forever on this side of the island surely won\'t work out well either. do you know of anyone whose death did not come from being either eaten by the wild beasts or from famine? that too is a terrible end, although it still seems far away to us." -"You\'re right, ariki. and if we wait much longer we won\'t have the strength to make the leap … let\'s do it tomorrow."And on the next day, naru and ariki jumped to the good side of the island. When taking up the poles, taking their run up, while feeling their desire, the fear hardly allowed them to breathe. And while flying through the air, helpless and without support, they felt that something surely must have gone wrong and certain death awaited them. But when they landed on the other side of the island and happily hugged each other, they thought the jump really hadn\'t been so bad after all. And as they ran away to discover their new life, behind them they could hear, like a whispering choir:   -"It was just luck." -"Well… maybe tomorrow." -"What a terrible jump! had it not been for the pole …"And naru and ariki understood why so few people took the leap: because on the bad side of the island you only ever heard the resigned voices of people without dreams, people filled with fear and despair, people who would never jump … ', 'We should always try to improve, not giving in to the kind of fear shown in people who have never attempted what they want to do in life.

['The first time luca heard talk of the island of inventions, he was still very young, but the wonders he heard about sounded so incredible to him that they were forever engraved in his memory. Ever since he was a little boy, he never stopped searching for clues to investigate. Clues which might lead him to that place of wonder. He read hundreds of adventure books, histories, volumes of physics and chemistry; even music. Taking a little from here, a little from there, he arrived at quite a clear idea of what the island of inventions was really like. It was a secret place, where all the great wise men of the world would meet to learn and invent together. Access to the island was totally restricted. To be able to join that select club, you had to have created some great invention for humanity. Only then could you receive the unique and special invitation - which came with instructions on how to get to the island. To be in with a chance, luca spent the years of his youth studying and inventing. Every new idea he got, he made it into an invention, and if there were ever anything he didn\'t understand, he would seek out someone who could help him. Soon he met other young people, brilliant inventors too, and he told them of the secrets and marvels of the island of inventions. These fellow young inventors would likewise dream of being sent \'the letter\', which is how the invitation was referred to. As time passed, the disappointment of not being sent the letter gave rise to even greater collaboration and mutual help between the young inventors. Their interesting individual inventions were put together, creating some incredible contraptions. They met in luca\'s house, which ended up looking like a huge warehouse for machines and spare parts. Their inventions became known throughout the world, and managed to improve every aspect of life. But even after all that, no invitation came. They did not lose heart. They continued learning and inventing every day, trying to come up with more and better ideas. Fresh young talent was added to their group, as more and more inventors dreamed of getting to the island. One day, a long time later, luca, already very old, was speaking with a brilliant young man who had written to him to try to join the group. Luca told the young man the great secret of the island of inventions, and of how he was sure that some day they would receive an invitation. Surprised, the young inventor interrupted luca:"What? you mean this isn\'t really the island of inventions? isn\'t the letter you sent me the real invitation?"And, as old as he was, luca looked around him, and realised that his dream had become true in his very own house. He realised that no island could exist which would be better than where he was now. No place of invention would be better than what he and his friends had created. Luca felt happy to know that he had always been on the island, and that his life of invention and study had been a truly happy one.

["Spuddles are small colourful creatures shaped like potatoes. Besides being fun and friendly, spuddles have one very special feature: every time a baby spuddle is born, depending on what colour it is, the baby's parents grow a new arm of that same colour. That arm is the one the parents will use to look after that baby. One day a blue baby spuddle was born, but its parents didn't grow a blue arm. Well, what a problem! How could the parents care for their blue baby if they only had the green arm they had used for the baby's older brother, and the pink arm they had used for his older sister? The first thing the parents tried was to attach a fake arm, but that was useless, and the baby did nothing but cry. Then they asked for help from other spuddle parents, but all of them were using their arms to look after their own children, and nobody could do anything. The parents of the little blue spuddle didn't know what to do, and they were filled with grief that their baby might die because they couldn't look after him. But then something happened that had never happened before. The green brother and the pink sister went to their parents and offered to share their special arms! The parents could not believe they had such generous and wonderful children that were willing to share their arms, despite knowing that if the arms were used to care for their brother it would often mean they could not be used to care for themselves, as they were being used for the baby.

And so much did they love their children, and so kind had the little green and pink spuddles been that the the two children each soon grew an amazing multicoloured arm, which they could use to help their parents care for the baby whenever they wanted.

['What I\'m about to tell you happened a long, long time ago, when I went to visit my aunt nina. She lived in an old house, with a great courtyard and many flowers. I loved going to stay with nina because I could play in her garden in the mornings, help her cook, and above all… have breakfast in bed! She always made my bed up on a sofa which stood against a wall in her bedroom. There I used to sleep every night, and as I was drifting off I liked to look at a big damp stain on the wall. I tried to make shapes out of that stain: faces, characters. One rainy night something very strange happened. Suddenly, I saw something extraordinary come out of that wall. It looked like a ghost made of cotton… except that it was dark, as dark as thunderclouds. I felt the ghost touching my shoulder, and as it did so, it turned into a grey lady of incredible beauty. Then, in a deep, but sweet, kind voice she said:   -"Good evening! my name is storm, and don\'t let my colour fool you, I\'m really a very good fairy. want to come with me?"And she offered me her hand. It was a slim, transparent hand, and smelled of raindrops. I was so surprised that I could not answer. The next thing I knew, I had been carried by some invisible force, taken from the warmth of my bed, and transported through the bedroom wall, through the middle of that damp stain…    -"Come on, come along, you\'ll love where we\'re going," Said the fairy, and with that we moved up, soaring, flying, faster and faster towards the heavens. We meandered through the air while behind us lightning struck and thunder roared, and through all of it I didn\'t feel the slightest fear. Along I went in complete confidence, holding onto storm\'s hand, and the rain fell incessantly beneath us. It seemed to come in waves, softly murmuring through the sky… storm smiled at me, and higher and higher we went. Then, just as smoothly as we had ascended, we began to float back down. We descended through a gradually clearing fog, and headed towards an area filled with light. In the blink of an eye we were bathed in sunlight, and around us were seven other figures. Seven more fairies, each just as beautiful and transparent as storm, each as sweet and kind, and they smiled at me just like she had…! Instead of magic wands they each had a slim golden paintbrush in one hand, and a painters\' palette in the other. Out from the fog which had surrounded us appeared flowers, plants, animals, all manner of things, but every one of them was completely colourless…each of the seven fairies took their leave of us and alighted upon a flower, a plant, an animal; any object of their choosing. Little by little, object by object, the fairies brought colour to the scene, until finally everything was just as we see it every day. My friend storm painted some chimney smoke, a beautiful horse, several little birds, and a cat that was so plump and gleaming that it looked like a silk pompom… well, I was so shocked by all this that I couldn\'t say a word. But an even bigger surprise was in store. I turned to look back at the path we had taken to arrive there, and saw that it was nothing less than… a rainbow, complete with all its resplendent colours. Meanwhile, storm and her friends took me by the hands and began to dance, singing a song:   -"How beautiful are the plants after the rain, the soaked flowers; everything gleaming, raindrops painting in their colours, a fresh coat! we\'re on light patrol, and this is our song!"And indeed I danced and sang with them, clapping in rhythm, and wanting to ask the fairies so many questions! When the song ended I would ask them. Of that I was sure. I was just about to let my curiosity off the leash when, suddenly, I heard my aunt nina\'s voice saying:    -"So now you sing in your sleep, do you? I think you\'re in need of a good breakfast. come on, I\'ll bring you some hot tea, and toast with peach jam, the kind I make especially for you!"I thought that if I told her what I\'d seen, she wouldn\'t believe me. Then she said this to me:    -"So you enjoyed your journey through the damp stain?"As my breakfast was getting cold, and I was going to be late for school, I didn\'t have time to answer her. Anyhow, I still believe that whenever it rains storm and her friends come to visit us, and they leave everything looking bright, fresh, and new… just as though it had just been painted by fairies.

['There was once a boy who always treated his mother horribly, shouting at her, insulting her. It didn\'t matter to him how sad he made her. One day, without knowing how, he woke up in an immense and lonely place. He was sitting on a rock from which four huge pillars rose up into the sky, appearing to support the entire world. He was all alone, but soon an enormous flock of crows with beaks made of steel landed on the rock, and set about violently chipping away at it. After the crows left, a mysterious door in one of the pillars opened, and through it came a charming and pretty girl. -"Have you come to help us? that\'s great! we need all the people we can get."The boy was puzzled, and spotting his confusion, the little girl explained. -"So you don\'t know where you are? this is the centre of the earth. these pillars support the whole planet, and this rock keeps the pillars in place." -"And how can I help you?" Said the boy, confused. -"Well, to help look after the rock, of course. anyone can see by your face that you\'re the best person for the job," Answered the girl, -"The birds you saw are only increasing in number, and if we don\'t look after this rock it will eventually crumble and everything will come crashing down." -"And what do you see in my face?!" Exclaimed the boy, surprised. -"I\'ve never looked after a rock in my whole life!" -"But you\'ll learn how, even if you\'ve never done it. here, look in this mirror," Said the girl, holding one in front of the boy\'s face. The boy could clearly see he now had the face of a bird, and his nose was gradually turning into steel. There he stood, shocked and worried, not a word passing his lips. -"All those crows used to be children like you and I, " Explained the girl, -"But they decided not to look after the rock. now that they\'re older they\'ve turned into evil birds; all they do is destroy. up to now, you haven\'t done much to look after it, but now that you know, will you help me to preserve all this?" She said all this with a smile, taking his hand in hers. The boy still didn\'t quite understand all this. He looked closely at the pillars and could see that each one was made of thousands and thousands of little figurines, representing the best virtues: sincerity, effort, honesty, generosity…closely inspecting the ground beneath him, he could see that the enormous rock was made up of little instances of children showing respect to their mothers, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and old people. What the crows were trying to do was cover over these instances by carving out scenes of shouting and insults. Next to his feet, he could see his own little carving, representing the last time he shouted at his mother. That image, in such a strange place, made him realise that the only thing keeping the columns standing was respect. Respect was sustaining the world. The boy, filled with regret, stayed there and looked after the rock for many days. He carried out his task joyfully, going without sleep to repel every crow attack. He carried on until, exhausted by his efforts, he collapsed; completely spent. When he woke he was back in his bed at home, and he didn\'t know whether it had all been a dream. However, what he was now sure of was that no crow would ever again get the chance to carve a picture of him shouting at his mother.

['Susannah was a shy but clever girl. She couldn\'t see too well, and had worn glasses for as long as she could remember. And again, for as long as she could remember, some of her classmates had habitually picked on her and made fun of her big glasses. The worst thing was that lewis had started calling her \'four eyes\', and as he was a very popular member of the class, the nickname stuck. Now everyone knew her as suzy four eyes. She acted like she didn\'t mind, but in fact susannah couldn\'t stand it. One day, the class went on a school outing to visit some famous caves. The children were walking towards the caves, when lewis put his foot in a hole and slipped. While falling, he grabbed onto susannah, who was walking next to him, and both plummeted down the hole, out of sight. After some time they landed in a very big dark, cave. All that could be seen was a single ray of light coming from the cave roof, many metres above, and some tree roots and trunks which had fallen through the hole. Susannah and lewis shouted for help, but no one came. Crouched together in the deathly cold of the cave, they endured a long dark night. The next morning they still hadn\'t been found, and without the small ray of light from above, they wouldn\'t have been able to see anything at all. Lewis continued shouting for help, while he used the meagre light to look for a way out. But after hours of searching and scrambling, he had found nothing, and started feeling scared. It must have been noontime, because susannah noticed that the ray of light was descending from the hole in a straight line, and landing on the floor in front of her. Quickly, she took a piece of wood that had fallen into the cave, and, using her glasses as a magnifying glass, she focused the ray of light onto the wood until a little flame sprang up. Now they had a torch. Lewis watched all this with surprise and excitement. He grabbed some more branches, and off they went together, to explore the cave. It took them some time, and they had to burn quite a few torches, but finally they found a way out. Amid hugs and cries of relief, lewis gave susannah his heartfelt thanks. He knew that she couldn\'t stand people calling her four eyes, and now he regretted having given her that name. Especially seeing that it was her glasses that had saved them both.

['Pete sparks was a sensitive boy. So sensitive that even his hair was ticklish. You only had to touch his hair a little bit and he would burst out laughing. And when this ticklish laughter started, no one could make him stop. So pete grew up used to strange situations. When his granny\'s friends came to visit, he would always end up in stitches because there was never any shortage of little old ladies rubbing his head and saying "How cute!"Windy days were the worst, with pete on the ground, paralyzed by laughter whenever the breeze blew on his locks, which, incidentally, were pretty long because at the barber shop no one could manage to cut his hair, due to the non-stop giggling. To see pete laugh, as well as being great fun, was terribly contagious. When pete started feeling ticklish, everyone ended up in endless laughter, and they had to just give up whatever they were doing. As pete grew up, people started to ban him from certain places. Some activities are serious business, and cannot be done amid gales of laughter. So pete tried everything to control his ticklishness: he tried wearing a thousand different hats, he used ultra strong hairsprays and gels, he shaved his head, and he even went on a yoga course to see if he could bear the tickling by learning to relax himself. But nothing worked; it was impossible. He wanted, with all his heart, to just be a normal boy. So, as time went on, he began to feel sad and ill-fated for being different. This went on until, one day in the street, he met a special clown. The clown was very old and could hardly walk, but when he saw pete in tears, he went to cheer him up. It didn\'t take long to make pete laugh, and they started to talk. Pete told him about his ticklish problem, and he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown. "I have no one to replace me", said the clown, "And I have a very serious job to do". Pete looked at him, surprised, and thought "Serious? a clown?", trying to understand what the old man had told him. "Come, I\'ll show you" Said the clown. So the clown took pete all over the city, to many hospitals, shelters, refuges, schools… all were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. Their short while spent with the clown changed everything for them, but that day was even more special, because in every show pete\'s ticklishness would inevitably make an appearance, and his contagious laughter would end up with the kids laid on the floor, dying with laughter. When the visit came to an end, the old clown winked at pete and said "Now do you see what a serious job it is? that\'s why I can\'t retire, even at my age". "It\'s true," Answered pete, smiling and returning the wink, "Not everyone could do it, you have to have a special gift for laughter. and that\'s so hard to find". This said, the wind again set off his ticklishness and his laughter. And that is how pete became a clown, and replaced the special old man. And from that day onward, the fact that pete was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift.

['Long ago, there was a magical place that held some of the world\'s great wonders and treasures. It was not an obscure place, nor was it hidden, and anyone could try to enter and enjoy its delights. All you had to do was fulfill one requirement: be a good person. You didn\'t have to be heroic or extraordinary: just a good person. One day, two young friends - ali and benaissa - went there to seek their fortune. Everyone who went there had to face their test alone, and ali was the first to try his luck. He soon found himself in a beautiful garden. It was decorated with hundreds of statues that looked so real that you felt that at any moment they could start walking about. Or perhaps cry, because the expressions on their faces were rather sad and melancholic. But ali refused to be distracted from his objective, and putting aside his desire to stay with the statues, he kept going until he arrived at the entrance to a large forest. The entrance was guarded by two grey stone statues which were very different from the others: one had an angry expression, and the other looked really joyful. Next to the entrance was an inscription: "Tell the statues about the goodness of your character."So ali got ready, cleared his throat and loudly said:   -"I\'m ali. a good person. I\'ve never done anyone any harm, and no one has any complaint about me."After a long silence, the statue with the joyful expression came to life, and stepping down from his pedestal, kindly said:   -"Excellent, your goodness is perfect for this place. as this place is full of statues like you. they too do no harm to anyone, and no one has any complaint about them!"And in the same instant ali felt his whole body become completely paralysed. He couldn\'t even move his eyes. But he could still see, hear and feel. Just enough to understand that he had become just one more statue to decorate the garden. Soon after, it was benaissa\'s turn to enjoy the wonders of the garden. But unlike his friend, the sight of those statues, and their sad, immobile eyes moved him so much that he approached each one and touched them, caressing their faces, secretly hoping that they were alive. As he touched them he felt the warmth of life, and could not get out of his mind the idea that they were indeed still alive, but imprisoned by some horrible curse. He wondered about their lives, and how they could have ended up here. Several times he ran to the fountain to bring water to wet their lips. And then he saw ali, so still and sad, just like the others. Benaissa, forgetting why he had gone there, did his best to free his friend, and many others, but without success. Finally, overcome by despair, he approached the statues guarding the entrance to the great forest. He read the inscription, but ignoring it, loudly said:   -"Some other day I will defend my good deeds. but today I have a friend trapped by a curse, and many others with him, and I would like to ask your help to save them …"When he had finished, the statue with the angry expression came to life amid the noise of his own grunts and complaints. And without losing his angry air, he said:   -"What rotten luck! here we have one who isn\'t a statue. well, we\'ll just have to let him go …! and on top of that he gets to take away one of our statues! so, which one do you want?"Benaissa looked over to his friend, and ali - who could move again - ran over and hugged him. Meanwhile, the trees of the forest opened the way to reveal a world of wonder and happiness. When a happy benaissa was just about to enter, it was ali himself who stopped him. And looking back, to all other statues, ali said determinedly:   -"Wait, benaissa. I will not behave like a statue anymore. let\'s do something for these people."And so the two friends ended up finding a way to release all the statues in the garden from their life of imprisonment. And these hundreds of people emerged hopeful of having a second chance to prove that never again would they live like statues. From that day forward they wouldn\'t simply live to do no wrong and to avoid having enemies. On the contrary, they would live to do a lot of good in the world and end up surrounded by friends.

I have your throat locked in my claws. so if one dies, we both dies."Crane realized danger and begged crab to leave his neck and promised not to eat him. Crab agreed. Crane flew down to shore and said, "Now, please release me. please trust me I won\'t eat you."Crab realized that crane could not be trusted and knew if he let of that crane, then one day he would be eaten for sure.

"Actually," The swan replied, "I was feeling that I was the happiest bird around until I saw a parrot, which has two colors. I now think the parrot is the happiest bird in creation."

['There was this guy who believed very much in true love and decided to take his time to wait for his right girl to appear.

He was\xa0aware that she still held some hope of re-kindling the past romance with him. He\xa0did not wish to mislead her in any way.

Therefore,\xa0she confronted him and professed that after all those years, he was still the\xa0only man that she had ever loved.

The girl asked. "Sure… yeah!", he replied. She was slightly tipsy… must be from the whiskey on her hand. She\xa0continued, "Why? don\'t you need someone to pose as your girlfriend this\xa0year?" Then he answered, "No, there is no need for that anymore."Before he can continue, he was interrupted, "Oh yes! must have found a\xa0girlfriend! you haven\'t been searching for one for the past years, right?"

I haven\'t been looking foranyone for the past years."With that, the man darted across the floor and out the door, leaving the lady\xa0in much bewilderment. He finally realized that he has already found his dream\xa0girl, and she was… the vancouver girl all along! The drunken lady has said\xa0something that awoken him. All along he has found his girl.

It was the\xa0perfection that he wanted, and yes… perfection! A\xa0relationship is something both parties should work on.

['A father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion. One day he told his sons to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the fagot into the hands of each of them in succession and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength and were not able to do it.

Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous frog had other plans. He pulled the mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead mouse, a hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the mouse floating on the water, the hawk swooped down, seized the mouse and carried it off, with the frog dangling from its leg.

A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The kid shivered as he thought of the terrible wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the wolf! The kid knew there was little hope for him.

Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the wolf\'s piping carried far. The shepherd dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture.

["Once upon a time there was a villain who was so thoroughly evil that he devised a plan to destroy every important thing in the world. His name was millisphore, and, helped by his great machines and inventions, he managed to ruin everything. After that, he created a potion that robbed people of their desire to work.

['Claudio was really happy with the way the work had been allocated. Of everything that needed preparing for the birth of jesus, he had been given \'the speaker\'. But it wasn\'t just any speaker: it was the speaker through which the voices of the angels and god himself would be heard on earth from heaven. Claudio was just an ordinary angel but had been very lucky because the bulk of the important tasks had been given to the most impressive and brilliant archangels and to other more senior angels. As everyone already knew, he was more than just a charming angel: he was also a whiz with technology, which is why they thought he would be ideal to create such a complicated device. Claudio had a thousand ideas for the design in his head and he set to work immediately. He hadn\'t been working long before raphael, one of his favourite archangels, came along. "Can you please give us a hand with the palace, claudio? we need a door that opens automatically for mary and joseph." "Of course!" - he said, willingly as ever - "This can wait." It took claudio several days to finish the complicated door, and even more to complete the other jobs that raphael kept asking him to do. But it was all worth it: they built a palace worthy of the greatest king on earth. It was so good that, when no one was looking, the angels came out of heaven to admire it. Claudio was walking back so he could work on his speaker when michael the archangel spotted him from afar. "Claudio, could you please help us with the finishing touches in wardrobe? when the choir sings we want the clothes of those listening to shine with gold, precious stones and colourful lights and the clothes of mary, joseph and the son of god to sway with the rhythm of the music.""What a fantastic idea, miguel! that will be amazing. I\'ll be there right away."Even though it took several days to finish the costumes, they could not have created anything more beautiful. Angels came from every corner of the universe to marvel at their beauty and congratulate michael warmly. Gabriel also asked claudio to help him with the lights and sound effects for the heavenly choir. Then the cherubs arrived asking for lots of help, as did large numbers of senior angels with jobs so important that claudio had no choice but to assist them. Everything was perfect. The angels were happy and congratulated one another proudly. That same night, the eve of the birth of the baby jesus, they celebrated with a big party. But claudio couldn\'t go. After so much work, he remembered that he had his own job to do - the speaker- which he had still not started! Alone and in a hurry, claudio worked on his speaker and could hear the background music from the party. He had tears in his eyes as he worked, knowing he wouldn\'t finish on time. Suddenly god himself appeared by his side. "Hello my dear claudio. what are you doing here and not at the party?" The little angel felt ashamed and, holding back the tears, showed him the partly finished speaker. "I see. I know that you were busy helping others. but is no one coming to help you?""Well, they are celebrating at the big party and they deserve it", answered claudio. "They have worked very hard and everything has turned out brilliantly. also, they couldn\'t help me even if they wanted to: this speaker is very complicated.""Hmmm" Was the only thing god said as he turned around. He didn\'t seem very happy. Claudio was terrified. He knew that the only way he would get there in time was if god decided to help him, but he was too embarrassed to ask. As if he had read his mind, god turned to claudio and said: "Well, do the best you can, but make sure it is really loud."Claudio didn\'t have time. He had just finished putting the pieces together in time and he managed to reach his place by the skin of his teeth, just as gabriel was giving the signal to begin. The choir cleared their voices and for a second everyone was looking at claudio. He closed his eyes, said a prayer and put the speaker on full volume. Boooooom! !! A huge explosion shook heaven as it opened up to send the angels\' hymn to earth. The explosion was so great that it was like an earthquake or a hurricane on earth, destroying all the preparations. The palace collapsed completely except for the remains of a few walls. The place felt cold, uncomfortable, dirty and untidy. Even the beautiful clothes of all who were there to witness the birth flew across the air, now nothing more than rags. In a matter of seconds, all that remained intact were the voices of the heavenly choir and a bright flash from the huge speaker which was slowly burning. No one in heaven dared say anything. Claudio was very embarrassed. Everyone was looking at him in pity and disappointment but they too were embarrassed for having left him all alone. Just then jesus was born but instead of the cries of a baby, which was what everyone was expecting, happy laughter filled heaven and earth. It was contagious laughter, letting them know that, although things had turned out poorly, god was happy with the preparations done largely by claudio, who had forgotten about his own problems to help everyone else. And as if they had expected something like this would happen, the three archangels whispered to themselves: "This is truly god\'s way: everything has turned out perfect".

He thought, "The crane has a long neck. she can reach and take out the bone". So off he went to the crane and said, "Please take out the bone from my neck. I will pay good". The crane took out the bone and asked for her fees. The wolf replied "Aren\'t you happy that you put your head into my mouth and got it out safely? forget the fees."

There was a fierce fight and both of them became tired. When they took rest for a while, they saw two vultures waiting for eating the defeated.

['There was a sculptor who carved beautiful idols of gods and goddesses. One day he had to take an idol of a goddess to a rich man. He mounted the idol on a donkey and started.

["The day had arrived. Brodek, the young dragon would have to choose his side, and become either a dragon of light or a dragon of darkness. Both groups, natural enemies, hated each other to death, and each dragon, when its time came, had to choose one side and join its army. Nearly all dragons decided while they were still young, and trained for years before the big change. But brodek was undecided. And now time had run out. At dawn, his wings would be covered with the dark blue of night or the gold of the sun, and so they would remain forever, and everything would be hatred for the sun or for the moon, without remedy. This was the price of the magic and terrible gift of breathing fire. Because of all this, brodek went to the forest to think, where he hoped to find an answer. But there, sitting in the silence of the night, there were no answers. Just a beautiful white full moon, with pale silver shimmer. And the wind in the leaves of the trees was softer and cooler than usual, as if saying farewell to the young dragon. And night, a deep night full of distant stars …for nothing in the world did brodek want to become a dragon of light in order to hate all that wonder, and he felt his wings slowly begin to dye into the colour of the night. But the night was losing its strength and making way for the first light of dawn. It was one of brodek's favourite times of day, and he enjoyed the pink tones of the sky, the gentle heat of the first ray of sun on his face, the glinting crystal and fire shining on the waters, and the joy that was awaking in the woods with the first birdsong …no, neither did he want to be a dragon of the night and have to hate such beauty. And before tears flooded his eyes, before even knowing the final colour of his wings, brodek flew to the lake, dove in as deep as he could to quench his thirst for peace, and then turned and flew up into the sky, as high as he could, as if trying to escape from the unjust land and his cruel fate. And when he had flown so high that the cold prevented him from moving his wings, he opened his mouth to spit out a great flame, as if to spend it completely, to never have it again. But instead of fire, from his mouth came a thin layer of frost that covered the fields below, as if his desire for peace and the lake water had worked a miracle. And only then did he discover that he wouldn't be a dragon of the darkness, and neither would he be a dragon of the light, since now one of his wings belonged to the moon, and the other to the sun. And every so often, brodek again decorates the fields with his magical frosty breath, as if to remind the world that it is not necessary to choose between day and night when you really don't know how to hate. ", 'A story for learning to notice and enjoy everything around us, rejecting any form of hate. ', 23]
["There was once a frog who lived in a pond next to an abandoned palace. Occasionally a traveling witch would come and stay in the palace. One day, the frog decided to go and have a look at the abandoned palace. He hopped over and jumped up to an old window frame. Instead of being filled with glass, the window frame was filled with what looked like a soap bubble. The frog was amused and wanted to pop the bubble by jumping through it. However, this was no soap bubble; it was the remains of a magic potion. As the frog jumped through it he found himself entering a very different place. It looked like he was entering a very rich person's house. The place smelt nice and was heated. But that didn't last very long: a dog spotted the frog and was about to catch him. Fortunately, with three great leaps, the frog managed to jump back out of the window… only to find himself now in a wonderful pond, full of frogs and toads of great beauty. The pond had an abundance of flies, and the frogs and toads croaked happily all day long. Our frog was neither handsome nor ugly; he was just pretty normal looking. This meant he wasn't greatly welcomed by the other frogs and toads, but he was enjoying himself so much that this didn't matter much to him. He lived there for many days, but one night a group of toads who were sick of the frog's common appearance, grabbed him while sleeping and threw him back through the window. The frog woke up in a dark, dilapidated, cold and uncomfortable bedroom. There was a young boy there, and the boy welcomed the frog with great happiness. Soon the boy and the frog were inseparable companions. The boy looked after him as best he could; he even caught flies for the frog. However, the frog couldn't help thinking about all the comforts of the wonderful pond he had experienced. One night, when the cold was worsening, and the firewood had run out, the frog hopped to the window and leapt out. He came out at the north pole! The frog felt like he was dying of cold, so he quickly jumped back through the window. This time he found himself in a desert, and when he again jumped through the window he was back among the arctic snows. It didn't matter how many times he jumped back and forth, he would always come out at either the north pole or the desert. While he was changing from one place to the other he remembered his good master, the poor boy, and how he, the frog, had been so ungrateful to the boy, and so loving of his own comfort, and how this had meant him ending up in this situation, half dead from hunger, and jumping from the worst of cold to the most searing heat.

['Ricky lived in a lovely, futuristic house, which had everything you could ever want. Though he didn\'t help much around the house, ricky was still as pleased as punch when his parents bought him the latest model of butler robot. As soon as it arrived, off it went; cooking, cleaning, ironing, and - most importantly - gathering up old clothes from ricky\'s bedroom floor, which ricky didn\'t like having to walk on. On that first day, when ricky went to sleep, he had left his bedroom in a truly disastrous state. When he woke up the next morning, everything was perfectly clean and tidy. In fact, it was actually "Too" Clean; now ricky couldn\'t find his favourite t-shirt, nor his favourite toy. However much he searched, the two items did not reappear, and the same was starting to happen with other things. Ricky cast a suspicious eye on the gleaming butler robot. He hatched a plan to spy on the robot, and began following it around the house. Finally he caught it red-handed, picking up one of ricky\'s toys to hide it. Off he went, running to his parents, to tell them that the butler was broken and badly programmed. Ricky asked them to have it changed. But his parents told him absolutely not; it was impossible, they were delighted with the new butler, and it cooked like a dream. So ricky needed to get some kind of proof; maybe take some hidden photos. He kept on at his parents, about how much good stuff the robot was hiding. This outweighed however good a cook it was, ricky argued. One day, the robot was whirring past, and heard the boy\'s complaints. The robot returned with one of the boy\'s toys, and some clothes for him. "Here, sir. I did not know it was bothering you," Said the butler, with its metallic voice. "How could it not, you thief?! you\'ve been nicking my stuff for weeks!" The boy answered, furiously. "The objects were left on the floor. I therefore calculated that you did not like them. I am programmed to collect all that is not wanted, and at night I send it to places other humans can use it. I am a maximum efficiency machine. were you unaware?" The robot said, with a certain pride. Ricky started feeling ashamed. He had spent all his life treating things as though they were useless. He looked after nothing. Yet it was true that many other people would be delighted to treat those things with all the care in the world. And he understood that the robot was neither broken nor misprogrammed, rather, it had been programmed extremely well! Since then, ricky decided to become a \'maximum efficiency boy\', and he put real care into how he treated his things. He kept them tidy, and made sure he didn\'t have more than was necessary. And, often, he would buy things, and take them along with his good friend, the robot, to help out those other people who needed them.

['Once upon a time there was a wicked wizard. One night the wizard visited a city and stole a thousand tongues from its sleeping inhabitants. He took these tongues and cast a spell on them. The spell meant that these tongues could only say bad things about people. Then the wizard returned the tongues to their owners, who suspected nothing. In very little time, that city was filled with the sound of people saying bad things about each other,"Yes, he did that, she did the other, boy, was that guy a bore, and the other guy was really clumsy…"Soon everyone was angry with everyone else, and this brought the wicked wizard no end of satisfaction. On seeing all this, the good wizard decided to intervene with his own powers. He cast a spell on the ears of the city dwellers. Under this spell, whenever the ears heard people criticising others, they would close up tightly, so that nothing could be heard. And so started the great and terrible battle between tongues and ears. The one endlessly criticising, the other blocking all this out. Who won the battle? Well, with the passing of time, the tongues started to feel completely useless. Why talk if no one was listening? Being tongues, they liked to be heard, so they gradually started to change the kind of things they would say. When the tongues realised that saying good things about people meant they would be listened to once again, they were filled with joy, and forgot forever the spell they had been under. Even to this day, the wicked wizard continues casting spells on tongues all over the world. But thanks to the good wizard now everyone knows that to put an end to gossiping, all one has to do is pay no attention to it.

['Corky was a brave young man, an expert swordsman, and he dreamed of becoming the best fighter in the world. In the whole army there wasn\'t a single soldier who could beat him. He hoped to become head of the army one day, so he could replace the cowardly old general who was currently in charge. The king liked corky, but when corky told him about his ambition to be appointed , the king looked a bit shocked and said,"Your desire is sincere, but I\'m afraid it can\'t happen right now. you still have much to learn."That was the worst thing that could have happened to corky, who became so furious that he stormed out of the palace, determined to learn all there was to know about fighting wars. He went to all kinds of schools and colleges, improving his technique and his strength, but without really learning any new secrets, until one day he went to a very special school, a huge grey fortress on top of a great mountain. He had heard it was the best military school in the world, and only very few students were allowed to train there. On his way he learnt that the old general had studied there, and corky proceeded, ever more determined to be accepted into the school to learn the great secrets of war. Before entering the fortress, he was made to hand in all his weapons. "You won\'t be needing those any more. here you\'ll be getting better ones", said the guard. Corky was impressed, and he handed his weapons to a little grey man who immediately threw them into a pit. One of the instructors, a serious old man of few words, accompanied corky to his room. As he left, the old man said, "In a hundred days the training will start." A hundred days! At first corky thought this was a joke, but he soon realised the man had been serious. The first days were filled with nervous tension, and corky tried all manner of silly tactics to try to get them to start the training. It didn\'t work, though, and he ended up waiting patiently, enjoying each day as it was. On the hundred and first day the first lesson began. "You have already learned how to use your main weapon: patience", began the wise old teacher. Corky could hardly believe it, and he let out a brief chuckle. The old man went on to remind him of all the crazy stunts corky had pulled in the first days, when he had been overcome by impatience. Corky had to admit the teacher was right. "Now it\'s time to learn how to win every battle," Said the old man. That sounded good to corky, that is, until he found himself tied hand and foot to a chair; a chair standing on top of a small pedestal, and with dozens of villagers climbing up to try to give him a good whack. He had little time to act, and the ropes were tight; he couldn\'t get out of this one. When the villagers climbed on the pedestal, they set to work, giving him a good beating. The very same exercise was repeated for days, and corky knew he would have to try some new tactics. He tried, and failed many times, until it dawned on him that the only way to prevent the attack would be to deal with the villagers\' anger. In the following days he kept talking to them, until he managed to convince them that he was no threat to them, but rather a friend. In the end, he was so persuasive that they gave up their hostility by themselves, and such a friendship developed that they offered to avenge corky by turning on the teacher. It was day two hundred and two. "You already control the most powerful weapon - the weapon of words. that which you couldn\'t achieve with strength or sword, you managed with your tongue," Said the old man. Corky agreed, and he prepared to continue his training. "Now, this is the most important part of all. here you will face the other students", said the teacher. He accompanied corky to a hall where seven other warriors were waiting. Every one of them looked strong, brave and fierce, just as corky did. Not only that, but in each one you could detect hints of the wisdom gained in the first two lessons. "Here you will fight, every man for himself. the winner will be the last man standing", said the teacher. And so, every morning, the seven warriors would fight it out. Each one disarmed, each one wise, they called for the group of villagers, and the warriors set about trying to influence the villagers against their opponents, using only words and patience. Each one devised tricks and deceptions to attack the others when they least expected it; and without so much as aiming a blow themselves, they succeeded in directing a ferocious battle. However, as the days passed, corky realised that both his own strength, and his villagers, were weakening. So he changed his tactics. Using his gift of the gab, corky gave up the fight, and he proposed using his villagers to help the others recover. His opponents were grateful to have one less enemy, as well as the welcome offer of help, and they intensified their fighting. Meanwhile, more and more villagers began to join corky\'s group, until finally one of the seven, named thunder, managed to triumph over the others. At thunder\'s side there now remained only a few villagers. When thunder had finished the fight and seemed victorious, the teacher stepped in, saying "No, only one can still remain standing". Thunder sent corky a threatening look, but corky stepped forward and said,"You really want to fight? can\'t you see there are fifty times more of us? these men gave up everything for me, I have let them live freely and in peace, you have no choice."On hearing this, the few villagers left at thunder\'s side moved over and joined corky. He had won! The old man then entered, grinning from ear to ear. "Of all the great weapons, peace is my favourite. sooner or later everyone joins the side of peace," He said. Corky smiled. Truly, in that school he had learned to wield much more powerful weapons than those he had handed in at the gate. Days later corky said his goodbyes, giving thanks to the old man. He returned to the palace, prepared to ask for forgiveness from the king for his imprudence. When the king saw him approach humbly, with neither shield nor weapons, he gave corky a wise and knowing smile. "What\'s new, general?"

["Once upon a time there was a good, cheerful wizard who loved to use his magic to make everyone happy. He was also quite an unusual wizard because he was allergic to a load of different foods. He had to be very careful what he put in his mouth. He was always being invited to parties, and he would always gladly accept, because he always had new tricks and games to try out. In the beginning, everyone was considerate about his allergies, and they took special care to prepare food that he would be able to eat safely. But as time went on, people tired of having to prepare special foods for him. They began to forget his dietary requirements. After having enjoyed his magic, people would leave him by himself, and the parties became less enjoyable. Sometimes they didn't even bother to tell him what was in the food, and, more than once, he ended up with a black tongue, a red face, and a very itchy body. Angry at such lack of consideration, he waved his wand and cast a huffy spell that gave everyone a special allergy. Some became allergic to birds or frogs, others to fruit or meat, some to raindrops… and so, each person had to take special care from then on. Whenever people met up to eat or have a party, they ended up having to go to the doctor. Ending parties in this way was such a pain that, gradually, people began making an effort to learn what each other's allergies were. Now they would prepare everything carefully, so that they could have a good time together without getting sick. Visits to the doctor decreased, and in less than a year, life in town returned to normal, filled with parties and celebrations, always attended by the wizard, who gave life and joy to the occasion. Even better, now he could stay and enjoy the whole party. No one would have suspected that, in that town, every single person was strongly allergic to something. Some time later, without anyone knowing, the wizard waved his wand again and undid the spell. The people had learned well how to be considerate towards others, and how they could enjoy each others' company even better just by making a little effort to adapt to each and every person. ", 'With very little effort, and some tact, you can be considerate to, and include everyone. ', 23]
["Once upon a time, a juggling clown came to a village. The clown went from town to town, earning a little money from his show. In that village he began his act in the square. While everyone was enjoying the show, a naughty boy started to make fun of the clown, telling him to leave the village. The shouts and insults made the clown nervous, and he dropped one of his juggling balls. Some others in the crowd started booing because of this mistake, and in the end the clown had to leave quickly. He ran off, leaving four of the juggling balls. But neither the clown nor his juggling balls were in any way ordinary. During that night, each one of the balls magically turned into a naughty boy, just like the one who had shouted the insults. All except one ball, which turned into another clown. For the whole of the next day, the copies of the naughty boy walked round the village, making trouble for everyone. In the afternoon, the copy of the clown started his juggling show, and the same thing happened as the previous day. But, this time, there were four naughty boys shouting, instead of one. Again, the clown had to run off, leaving another four balls behind. Once more, during the night, three of those balls turned into copies of the naughty boy, and one turned into a clown.

["Redbeard was the fiercest, most terrifying pirate on the seven seas. They said his attacks and boardings throughout the world had amassed him a fabulous amount of treasure, the greatest ever known. Like any good pirate, redbeard trusted no one, and always kept his treasure right under his feet, in the enormous hold of his ship. One day, he heard talk of a magnificent treasure that was to cross the sea in one of the world's most powerful ships. It was a tremendously big galleon, and it was very well armed, but no one enjoyed stealing treasure from big ships and then sinking them more than redbeard, even though he was already so rich that he would have needed many lifetimes simply to spend the gold and jewels he had amassed. So, the pirate carefully prepared an attack on the open sea. As ever, the boarding was a success, and they were soon busy moving the fabulous treasure from the galleon over to redbeard's ship. Without doubt, this was a formidable haul of treasure, almost as big as what redbeard already had. He rubbed his hands, thinking about continuing to multiply his riches. When they had loaded all the treasure, they sank the galleon, and the pirates prepared a great feast to celebrate the deed. As drunk as they became, they didn't realise that their own ship was gradually sinking, since the treasure haul had been so big and heavy that the boat could not stay afloat. By the time they realised, there was nothing that could be done. The ship went to the bottom of the sea with all its wicked pirates, led by redbeard himself.

['Once upon a time there were two beautiful princesses whom, when still young, had been kidnapped by a hostile king. The king arranged to have them taken to a forgotten lake where they were abandoned on a small island. Here they were to remain for ever, guarded by a terrifying lake monster. Only when the wicked king and his court of wizards and fortune-tellers had been overthrown did it become known that a brave prince was destined to liberate the princesses from their captivity. When the wind carried this news to the island, it filled the princesses\' lives with hope. The youngest, who was much sweeter and more beautiful than her sister, patiently waited for her love, making small decorations from flowers and clay, and singing love songs. The older princess, however, didn\'t enjoy having to wait. -"I\'ll have to do something to help the prince rescue me. at least so he knows where I am, or he knows what the lake monster\'s like." Determined to help the prince, she set to work, making signal fires, building towers, digging tunnels and a thousand other things. However, the terrible lake monster always did his best to scupper her plans. As time went on, the older sister felt increasingly uncomfortable. She knew the prince would choose the younger sister, so she felt there wasn\'t much sense in keeping waiting. From that point on, she concentrated on trying to escape from the island and the lake monster, not worrying any more about the prince or whether he would rescue them. Every morning she would prepare a different escape plan, but the monster would always manage to ruin it. The escape attempts went on day after day, and always ended with the monster capturing her. They became like a game of cat and mouse between the princess and her guard. Each escape attempt was more original and ingenious than its predecessor, and each form of discovery was ever more subtle and surprising. They put so much effort and imagination into their plans that at the end of each day the princess and the monster would spend hours chatting like friends, about how they had each prepared their strategy. And when the moon came out they would say farewell, until tomorrow, and the monster would dive back down to the watery depths. One day, the monster bid farewell to the princess like this:   -"Tomorrow I will allow you to go. you are a clever and brave young girl. you don\'t deserve to remain imprisoned like this."But the following morning the princess didn\'t try to escape. She sat by the water, waiting until the monster appeared. -"Why haven\'t you gone?" Asked the monster. -"I didn\'t want to leave you here all alone. it\'s true that you\'re scary, and you\'re enormous, but you too are clever, and you deserve something better than just guarding princesses. why don\'t you come with me?" -"I can\'t," Answered the monster, sadly    -"I can\'t leave the island, I\'m attached to it by a long chain. you will have to leave on your own."The princess approached the terrifying beast and hugged it with all her might. So tightly did she hug the monster that it broke up into a thousand pieces. And out from among those pieces appeared a slim, smiling young man, with the same intelligent expression as had had the lake monster. And so it was that the princesses discovered their rescuing prince, and that he had been with them all along. They hadn\'t known that for him to rescue them, first they would have to rescue him. This was only made possible thanks to the spirit and positive attitude of the older sister.
