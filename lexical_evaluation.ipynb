The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. \"What a fool I am,\" He said. \"Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.\"And off he walked very, very scornfully.
